So,this is a Hendrix song,but the Red Hot Chili Peppers played it live many
times.And a live version of this song is on an album (Under the covers) too.
These are the chords,but you can find a guitar tab (the Hendrix version,but rhcp
played this song the same way.)


[ch]G[/ch]: 355433
[ch]F[/ch]: 133211
[ch]Am[/ch]:x02210
[ch]F[/ch]?:x3301x  &lt;-------This is the "gossip"-"garden"-"warrior"-"indian" chord.


For the intro and the chorus see the "Hendrix:Castles made of sand" guitar tab.
I can't write the intro and the chorus chords yet.
 
*************************************


[Intro]
 

[ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]
Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace"
[ch]Am[/ch] 
As she slams the door in his drunken face,
[ch]Em7[/ch]                                     [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]?          [ch]G[/ch]
And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool.

[ch]G[/ch]  [ch]F[/ch]
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad,
[ch]Am[/ch]
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
[ch]Em7[/ch]
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
[ch]F[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]?             [ch]G[/ch]
And his tears fall and burn the garden green.


[Chorus]

And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually.


[Verse 2]

[ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]                                          
A little Indian brave who before he was ten, 
       [ch]Am[/ch]
played war games in the woods with his Indian friends, 
[ch]Em7[/ch]
and he built a dream that when he grew up,
[ch]F[/ch]                               [ch]G[/ch]?    [ch]G[/ch]
he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.

[ch]G[/ch]    [ch]F[/ch]                         
Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow
[ch]Am[/ch]
He would sing his first war song,
[ch]Em7[/ch]
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,
[ch]F[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]?             [ch]G[/ch]
Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night


[Chorus]

And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually.


[Verse 3]

[ch]G[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]                                           
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,
[ch]Am[/ch]                              
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
[ch]Em7[/ch]
And she wished and prayed she would stop 
[ch]F[/ch]          [ch]F[/ch]?          [ch]G[/ch]
living,so she decided to die.

[ch]G[/ch]           [ch]F[/ch]                                          
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, 
[ch]Am[/ch]
and to her legs she smiled: "You won't hurt me no more."
[ch]Em7[/ch]
But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY
[ch]F[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]?             [ch]G[/ch]
"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"

And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.


[Chorus]

And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, 
Eventually


[Outro]
