Dukey: F?:x3301x = Csus4 (if your root is the 3rd fret on the 5th string) or Fsus2 (if your root is the 3rd fret on the 4th string)

So,this is a Hendrix song,but the Red Hot Chili Peppers played it live many
times.And a live version of this song is on an album (Under the covers) too.
These are the chords,but you can find a guitar tab (the Hendrix version,but rhcp
played this song the same way.)


G: 355433
F: 133211
Am:x02210
F?:x3301x  &lt;-------This is the "gossip"-"garden"-"warrior"-"indian" chord.


For the intro and the chorus see the "Hendrix:Castles made of sand" guitar tab.
I can't write the intro and the chorus chords yet.

[Intro]
 

G        F
Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace"
Am 
As she slams the door in his drunken face,
Em7                                     F              F?          G
And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool.

G  F
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad,
Am
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Em7
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
F               F?             G
And his tears fall and burn the garden green.


[Chorus]

And so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually.


[Verse 2]

G        F                                          
A little Indian brave who before he was ten, 
       Am
played war games in the woods with his Indian friends, 
Em7
and he built a dream that when he grew up,
F                               G?    G
he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.

G    F                         
Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow
Am
He would sing his first war song,
Em7
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,
F               F?             G
Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night


[Chorus]

And so castles made of sand, melts into the sea eventually.


[Verse 3]

G          F                                           
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,
Am                              
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
Em7
And she wished and prayed she would stop 
F          F?          G
living,so she decided to die.

G           F                                          
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, 
Am
and to her legs she smiled: "You won't hurt me no more."
Em7
But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY
F               F?             G
"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"

And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.


[Chorus]

And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, 
Eventually


[Outro]
