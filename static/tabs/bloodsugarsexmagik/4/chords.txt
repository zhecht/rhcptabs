G
There are no monks in my band
There are no sainst in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man

Confusion is my middle name
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Persuaded by one sexy dame
No I do not feel no shame

G
Every man has certain needs
Talkin' 'bout them dirty deeds
To these needs I must concede
Livin' my lowly creed

Woman please know that I'm good
Know that I did all I could
But yes it's true likelihood
Of being great is not so good

G
There are no monks in my band
There are no sainst in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man

Virtue slipped into my shoe
No I will not misconstrue
More rockin' more rockin' now doobcey do
Dancin' down your avenue
