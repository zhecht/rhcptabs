Am                     C
  What I've got you've got to give it to your mama
Am                     C
  What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
Am                     C
  What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
    Am                    C
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

Am                     C
  What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Am                     C
  What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Am                     C
  What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Am                       C
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue

Am        C
  Realize I don't want to be a miser
Am        C
  Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Am            C
  Young blood is the lovin' upriser
Am                 C
How come everybody want to keep it like the kaiser

[Chorus]
Am             
  Give it away give it away give it away now 
Am             
  Give it away give it away give it away now 
Am             
  Give it away give it away give it away now 
Am
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse]

Am                   C
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Am             C
Keep your more to receive your less
Am            C
  Unimpressed by material excess
Am           C
Love is free love me say hell yes

Am         C
  Low brow but I rock a little know how
Am        C
  No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Am          C
  Get smart get down with the pow wow
Am                  C
Never been a better time than right now

Am       C
  Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Am       C
  Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Am       C
  Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Am          C
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

[Chorus]

      Am             C
Lucky me swimmin' in my ability
        Am           C
Dancin' down on life with agility
         Am               C
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Am                    C
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

Am       C
  My mom I love her 'cause she love me
Am          C
  Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Am             C
  Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Am             C
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me

Am                C
  There's a river born to be a giver
Am              C
  Keep you warm won't let you shiver
Am          C
  His heart is never gonna wither
Am                C
Come on everybody time to deliver
