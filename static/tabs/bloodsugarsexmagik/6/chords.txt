19_sukosanac_13: I randomly playbacked RHCP songs from my library and stumbled on this one... such a beautiful song, I'm happy that I've found it and the tabs helped also a bit :)

chadfreels: 1st song i taught my girl...Thanks!

mattverve: For beginners having trouble keeping time with the Aadd9, Asus2 works as well.

[Intro]
Bm A G x2

[Verse]
Bm
There must be something
In the way I feel
     A         G          Bm  A G
That she don't want me to feel
    Bm
The stare she bares cut me
A       G
I don't care
                     Bm   A G
You see so what if I bleed
  
  B
I could never change
     D
Just what I feel
   Aadd9
My face will never show
G
What is not real

[Interlude]
Bm A G x2

[Verse 2]
  Bm
A mountain never seems to have
The need to speak
  A         G              Bm  A G
A look that shares so many seek
    Bm
The sweetest feeling
         
I got from you
    A         G                Bm  A G
The things I said to you were true
 
  B
I could never change
     D
Just what I feel
   Aadd9
My face will never show
G
What is not real

Bm A G

[Hook]  
  Em                  G
I could have lied I'm such a fool
   D                      C
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Em               G
Showed her and I told her now
    D                 C
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

Bm A G x6

[Verse 3]
    Bm
But now she's gone yes she's gone away
  A       G
A soulful song
               Bm  A G
That would not stay
    Bm
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
    A       G
But I don't care
           Bm    A G
I won't be spared
 
[Chorus]
  Em                  G
I could have lied I'm such a fool
   D                      C
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Em               G
Showed her and I told her now
    D                 C
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

  Em                  G
I could have lied I'm such a fool
   D                      C
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Em               G
Showed her and I told her now
    D                 C
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
