I've got a soul
That can not sleep
At night when something
Just ain't right
Blood red
But without sight
Exploding egos
In the night
Mix like sticks
Of dynamite
Red black or white
This is my fight
Come one courage
Let's be heard
Turn feelings
Into words
American equality
Has always been sour
An attitude
I would like to devour
My name is peave
This is my hour
[ch]D9[/ch]/[ch]F#[/ch]
 Can I get
Just a little bit of power


    [ch]Db[/ch]        [ch]Gb[/ch]
The power of equality
[ch]Db[/ch]                  [ch]Gb[/ch]
 Is not yet what it ought to be
[ch]Db[/ch]                     [ch]Gb[/ch]
 It fills me up like a hollow tree
[ch]Db[/ch]             [ch]Gb[/ch]
 The power of equality

[ch]Ebm7[/ch]/[ch]Db[/ch]


[ch]Ebm7[/ch]/[ch]Db[/ch]
Right or wrong
My song is strong
You don't like it
Get along
Say what I want
Do what I can
Death to the message
Of the ku klux klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief
You menace me
The people you say
Cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker
And smell the slime
Blackest anger
Whitest fear
Can you hear me
Am I clear
My name is peave
This is my hour
[ch]D9[/ch]/[ch]F#[/ch]
 Can I get
Just a little bit of power


    [ch]Db[/ch]        [ch]Gb[/ch]
The power of equality
[ch]Db[/ch]                  [ch]Gb[/ch]
 Is not yet what it ought to be
[ch]Db[/ch]                     [ch]Gb[/ch]
 It fills me up like a hollow tree
[ch]Db[/ch]             [ch]Gb[/ch]
 The power of equality

I've got tapes
I've got C.D.s
I've got my public enemy
My lilly white ass
Is tickled pink
When I listen to the music
That makes me think
Not another
Motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something
For his own ambition
Never touch
The sound we make
Soul sacred love
Vows that we take
To create straight
What is true
Yo he's with me
And what I do
My name is peave
This is my hour
[ch]D9[/ch]/[ch]F#[/ch]
 Can I get
Just a little bit of power

Madder than a motherfucker
Lick my finger
Can't forget
'Cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick
Little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick
Eat my thickness
I've got a welt
From the bible belt
Dealing with the hand
That I've been deact
Sitting in the grip
Of a killing fist
Giving up blood
Just to exist
Rup me wrong
And I get pissed
No I can not
Get to this
People in pain
I do not dig it
Change of brain
For mr. Bigot
Little brother do you hear me
                [ch]Ebsus4[/ch]
Have a heart oh come get near me
[ch]Ebm7[/ch]/[ch]Db[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch]
 Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
[ch]Ebm7[/ch]/[ch]Db[/ch]
 What I see is insanity
                     [ch]Ebsus4[/ch]
Whatever happened to humanity
[ch]Ebm7[/ch]/[ch]Db[/ch]            [ch]Eb[/ch]
 Whatever happened to humanity
Whatever happened to humanity
