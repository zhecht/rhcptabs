[Intro]

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]D[/ch] [ch]Eb[/ch] (x2)

[Verse 1]

[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
Please don't ask me who, 
[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
Who you think I am 
[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
I could live without that
[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
I'm just a modest man 

[Chorus]

[ch]Ab[/ch]             [ch]Eb[/ch]     [ch]Gm[/ch]
Meet at the corner and tell
Tell me what to do
            [ch]Cm[/ch]
'Cause I messed up on you 
and had I known
       [ch]Eb[/ch]
All that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now 
[ch]Ab[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]    
receding into the forest I will
[ch]Gm[/ch]
Lay around in wait 
                [ch]Cm[/ch]
And I wait for you.

[Verse 2]

[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
Please don't ask me where
[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch] 
Where you think I been
[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch] 
I've been a lot of places
[ch]Ab[/ch]             [ch]Gm[/ch]     [ch]Cm[/ch]
But this could be my win

[Chorus]

[ch]Ab[/ch]             [ch]Eb[/ch]     [ch]Gm[/ch]
Meet at the corner and tell
Tell me what to do
            [ch]Cm[/ch]
'Cause I messed up on you 
and had I known
       [ch]Eb[/ch]
All that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now 
[ch]Ab[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]    
receding into the forest I will
[ch]Gm[/ch]
Lay around in wait 
                [ch]Cm[/ch]
And I wait for you.

[Bridge]

[ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
I feel so bad 
    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I thought you wanna know
[ch]Em[/ch]    [ch]D[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]
I feel so bad 
    [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]C[/ch]
I thought you wanna know
                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Something I want to show
                       [ch]Cm[/ch]    [ch]Eb[/ch]    [ch]Fm[/ch]
I thought you ought to know

[Verse 3]

[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
Please don't say you want 
[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
To keep in touch out there
[ch]Cm[/ch]              [ch]Eb[/ch]
To see you on the corner
[ch]Ab[/ch]           [ch]Gm[/ch]         [ch]Cm[/ch]
Well that I just can't bear

[Chorus]

[ch]Ab[/ch]             [ch]Eb[/ch]     [ch]Gm[/ch]
Meet at the corner and tell
Tell me what to do
            [ch]Cm[/ch]
'Cause I messed up on you 
and had I known
       [ch]Eb[/ch]
All that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now 
[ch]Ab[/ch]                 [ch]Eb[/ch]    
receding into the forest I will
[ch]Gm[/ch]
Lay around in wait 

[Bridge]

[ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
Hey and I turn
[ch]Db[/ch]                       [ch]Ab[/ch]
I turned my head and I thought 
         [ch]Eb[/ch]
I saw a sign
         [ch]Bb[/ch]
From the gods
[ch]Db[/ch]      
A sign from the gods
         [ch]Ab[/ch]                    [ch]Eb[/ch]
That you weren't meant to be mine
         [ch]Bb[/ch]
And it's fine
[ch]Db[/ch]                  [ch]Ab[/ch]
Takin' it all for a ride
                      [ch]Eb[/ch]        [ch]Bb[/ch]
Until the day when it's gone
[ch]Db[/ch]              [ch]Ab[/ch]
Mystified by where
         [ch]Eb[/ch]
It all went wrong
      [ch]Bb[/ch]
When it's gone

[Outro]

[ch]Db[/ch]              
I live and I learn
[ch]Ab[/ch]              
And I lose and I win
          [ch]Eb[/ch]
But it's better than ever
[ch]Bb[/ch]
Whenever I'm in
         [ch]Db[/ch]
I thank you girl
         [ch]Ab[/ch]                    [ch]Eb[/ch]
For everywhere that we've been

pqrqcf: It's easier to play this with a capo on 3, then transpose the song down three steps. I'm also fairly positive the A chords noted should be G# chords. 

Still, good tab. Just a quick glance at it and I got the song.

elricardo: Ab is a G# bro

chris_is_here: You have some G#'s in there that should be noted as Ab, but that might be an UG problem.

Sounds good to me.
