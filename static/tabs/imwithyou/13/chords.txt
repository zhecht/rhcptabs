pqrqcf: It's easier to play this with a capo on 3, then transpose the song down three steps. I'm also fairly positive the A chords noted should be G# chords. 

Still, good tab. Just a quick glance at it and I got the song.

elricardo: Ab is a G# bro

chris_is_here: You have some G#'s in there that should be noted as Ab, but that might be an UG problem.

Sounds good to me.

[Intro]

Cm D Eb (x2)

[Verse 1]

Cm              Eb
Please don't ask me who, 
Cm              Eb
Who you think I am 
Cm              Eb
I could live without that
Cm              Eb
I'm just a modest man 

[Chorus]

Ab             Eb     Gm
Meet at the corner and tell
Tell me what to do
            Cm
'Cause I messed up on you 
and had I known
       Eb
All that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now 
Ab                 Eb    
receding into the forest I will
Gm
Lay around in wait 
                Cm
And I wait for you.

[Verse 2]

Cm              Eb
Please don't ask me where
Cm              Eb 
Where you think I been
Cm              Eb 
I've been a lot of places
Ab             Gm     Cm
But this could be my win

[Chorus]

Ab             Eb     Gm
Meet at the corner and tell
Tell me what to do
            Cm
'Cause I messed up on you 
and had I known
       Eb
All that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now 
Ab                 Eb    
receding into the forest I will
Gm
Lay around in wait 
                Cm
And I wait for you.

[Bridge]

Em    D     G
I feel so bad 
    D                C
I thought you wanna know
Em    D     G
I feel so bad 
    D                C
I thought you wanna know
                    Am
Something I want to show
                       Cm    Eb    Fm
I thought you ought to know

[Verse 3]

Cm              Eb
Please don't say you want 
Cm              Eb
To keep in touch out there
Cm              Eb
To see you on the corner
Ab           Gm         Cm
Well that I just can't bear

[Chorus]

Ab             Eb     Gm
Meet at the corner and tell
Tell me what to do
            Cm
'Cause I messed up on you 
and had I known
       Eb
All that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now 
Ab                 Eb    
receding into the forest I will
Gm
Lay around in wait 

[Bridge]

Eb          Bb
Hey and I turn
Db                       Ab
I turned my head and I thought 
         Eb
I saw a sign
         Bb
From the gods
Db      
A sign from the gods
         Ab                    Eb
That you weren't meant to be mine
         Bb
And it's fine
Db                  Ab
Takin' it all for a ride
                      Eb        Bb
Until the day when it's gone
Db              Ab
Mystified by where
         Eb
It all went wrong
      Bb
When it's gone

[Outro]

Db              
I live and I learn
Ab              
And I lose and I win
          Eb
But it's better than ever
Bb
Whenever I'm in
         Db
I thank you girl
         Ab                    Eb
For everywhere that we've been
