Verse 1:

E5
   The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep.
Do you like it rough I ask and are you on to task?
The calicoes of pettibon where cultures come to clash


Chorus:

C             Em                     C              Em
Several of my best friends wear, the colours of the crown
    C             Em              D               Bm
And Mary wants to fill it up, and Sherry wants to tear it all back 

C     Em
down, girl
    C              Em
The savior of your life
    D           Bm
The monarchy of roses
    D           Bm      E5
The monarchy of roses tonight


Verse 2:

E5
  The cloth between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears that I am in, the lovely cross to bear


Chorus:

C             Em                     C               Em
Several of my best friends know, the secrets of this town
    C             Em               D               Bm
And Mary wants to raise it up, and Sherry wants to split it all   

C      Em
around, girl
    C               Em
The sailors of the night
    D           Bm
The monarchy of roses
    D           Bm             E5
The monarchy of roses tonight


Solo Chords: (This part is kind of iffy, but these chords sound 

really good for an acoustic version of the song. Although they may 

not be the chords actually used in the song, they use all the 

notest that Josh uses in the solo, and give the same feeling if 

you're playing alone.)

    C             Em              D               Bm
