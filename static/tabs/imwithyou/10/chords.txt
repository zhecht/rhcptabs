C#m                      F#m
Stop marching 'cause you think you shot to number one
C#m               F#m
Counting days and skipping your stones into the sun 
C#m                 F#m
Over edge and under thumb does it weigh a ton 
C#m                     F#m
I'll be yours tonight,  living the dream of a meteorite 


E                   Bm                     D    A 
Stop jumping 'cause we've got something to say, yeah 
E                    Bm                          D   A    F#
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah


C#m                    F#m
Short stroking doesn't fly better to go for broke
C#m                  F#m
Whatcha smoking Mary Jane? And does it make you choke 
C#m                           F#m
Jumping the fence, riding the waves, can you take a joke?
C#m                  F#m
I'll be yours today, living the dream with a capital K 


E                   Bm                     D    A 
Stop jumping 'cause we've got something to say, yeah

Just show me where to send


D             A             G
Make time for love and your happiness 
D              A                 G
The mothers of invention are the best 
D                A                  G
We all know and struggle with some loneliness 
D                 A          G
A tender mess for everyone I guess
  F#
I guess


C#m              F#m
Half blinded I'm reminded how to find my stairs 
C#m                          F#m        
Nickel and dime I think it's time to play some musical chairs 
C#m                   F#m          
Dirty laundry, what a wandering ask her if she cares 
C#m                     F#m
I'll be yours and more, better than ever like never before 


E                   Bm                     D    A

C#m                   F#m
Sweet talking, as I'm walking to your part of town 
C#m                          F#m       
Never again, we're trying to see your love supremed and bound 
C#m                 F#m
Is it ever meant to be and is it so profound
C#m                F#m
Is it you and me a billion to one make history


C#m       F#m
A history
