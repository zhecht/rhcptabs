Verse 1:

[ch]Cm[/ch]                                          
 God is good and fate is great / When it feels
[ch]Gm[/ch]
so strong It's hard to wait / You never know
[ch]Cm[/ch]
how it might unfold / Hearts to break and bodies 
[ch]Gm[/ch]
to hold / Time will tell but it never gets old
[ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]D#[/ch]       [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like I told you I'm in for a long long...

Verse 2:

[ch]Cm[/ch]
Had to have been one of those things / That took place in 
[ch]Gm[/ch]
outer space / A match made in heaven / Not a scratch on her 
[ch]Cm[/ch]
 face / Angels must have smoked some dust
[ch]Gm[/ch]
 Singing songs 'bout in God we trust / Some things 
[ch]F[/ch]                                                    [ch]D#[/ch] [ch]Dm[/ch]   [ch]A#m[/ch] [ch]Bm[/ch]
slide but this is a must / Like I told you there's a time for finding out

Verse 3:

[ch]Cm[/ch]
 People try to tell me / What not to do / You shouldn't 
[ch]Gm[/ch]
make it with a younger girl
[ch]Cm[/ch]
 Too many chances / For the foot to drop / I tried to
[ch]Gm[/ch]
tell them that I found a pearl
[ch]F[/ch]                   [ch]D#[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like I told you be careful what you're asking for

Chorus:

[ch]Gm[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]            [ch]Dm[/ch]  [ch]C#m[/ch]
Hey, sister Brutus / I've got a 
[ch]Cm[/ch]               [ch]Gm[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
mess of a better half
[ch]Gm[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
Hey, sister Judas / Even
[ch]Cm[/ch]               [ch]Gm[/ch]     [ch]Dm[/ch]
you never had my back

Verse 4:

[ch]Cm[/ch]
 She was the cutest thing / That I ever did see
[ch]Gm[/ch]
Drink in her hand and I don't mean tea / She was with a
[ch]Cm[/ch]
dude / But I just didn't care / I had to find out
[ch]Gm[/ch]
these moments are rare / And Stevie says 
[ch]F[/ch]                                        [ch]D#[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
'All is fair' / Like I told you there is something for everyone

Verse 5:

[ch]Cm[/ch]
 Well I guess I never told you some things / That I 
[ch]Gm[/ch]
really really wanted to say
[ch]Cm[/ch]
 Did I do everything that I could do / Or did the
[ch]Gm[/ch]
mice just need to play
[ch]F[/ch]                         [ch]D#[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like I told you there is more than meets the eye

*Chorus* then *Intro*

Verse 6:

[ch]Cm[/ch]
 I'm not trying to point fingers at you / And I'm 
[ch]Gm[/ch]
not trying to lay any blame
[ch]Cm[/ch]
 But when it comes to the punishment / Girl you
[ch]Gm[/ch]
know how to bring the pain
[ch]F[/ch]                     [ch]D#[/ch]    [ch]Bm[/ch]
 Like I told you, I'd do it all again

*Chorus*

[ch]Gm[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]C#m[/ch]
Hey, sister Brutus / There's a
[ch]Cm[/ch]                  [ch]Gm[/ch]       [ch]Dm[/ch]
fury to the woman's wrath
[ch]Gm[/ch]          [ch]Dm[/ch]      [ch]Dm[/ch] [ch]C#m[/ch]
Hey, sister Judas / Even
[ch]Cm[/ch]               [ch]Gm[/ch]     [ch]Gm[/ch]
you never had my back
