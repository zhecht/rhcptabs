Cm                                          
 God is good and fate is great / When it feels

so strong It's hard to wait / You never know

how it might unfold / Hearts to break and bodies

to hold / Time will tell but it never gets old

Had to have been one of those things / That took place in 
Gm
outer space / A match made in heaven / Not a scratch on her

 face / Angels must have smoked some dust

 Singing songs 'bout in God we trust / Some things

Cm
 People try to tell me / What not to do / You shouldn't

tell them that I found a pearl

mess of a better half
Gm          Dm      Dm C#m
Hey, sister Judas / Even

you never had my back

Verse 4:

Cm
 She was the cutest thing / That I ever did see
Gm
Drink in her hand and I don't mean tea / She was with a
Cm
dude / But I just didn't care / I had to find out
Gm
these moments are rare / And Stevie says 
F                                        D#        Bm
'All is fair' / Like I told you there is something for everyone

Cm
 Well I guess I never told you some things / That I 
Gm
really really wanted to say
Cm
 Did I do everything that I could do / Or did the
Gm
mice just need to play
F                         D#        Bm
 Like I told you there is more than meets the eye

Cm
 I'm not trying to point fingers at you / And I'm

not trying to lay any blame
Cm
 But when it comes to the punishment / Girl you
Gm
know how to bring the pain
F                     D#    Bm
 Like I told you, I'd do it all again

*Chorus*
