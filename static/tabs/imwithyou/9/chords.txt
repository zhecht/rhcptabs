Tuning: standard

Am        A#m
Woop Woop! Ha

Am
Junior paints that old cafe,
                                                    A#m
He's gotta change those girls around.
Am
Westbound drunk with lots to say,

But he never makes a sound.

Hustlers get what they deserve,
                                    A#m
But its always half the date.
Am
Good things come to those who wait,

Like an expiration date.


[Chorus]
Am
See you around, I'll see you around
     G
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
   Em                                      Dm
I lead all your mind games astray.
Am
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around,
     G
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
       Em                                     Dm         F
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray.
       Am
Aww


Am
Curb your tongue oh scallywag,
                                                A#m
Because you got no flag to wave.
Am
Save your breath for the black and white,

Every dog will have its day.


[Chorus:]
Am
See you around, I'll see you around
     G
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
   Em                                      Dm
I lead all your mind games astray.
Am
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around,
     G
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
       Em                                     Dm         F
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray.
            G                            E
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you arou-hound!

I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
   Em                                      Dm
I lead all your mind games astray.
Am
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around,
     G
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
       Em                                     Dm         F

I'll see you around, I'll see you around,
     Em
I'll see you around.

Goodbye and Hooray
