Tuning: standard

[ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]A#m[/ch]
Woop Woop! Ha

[ch]Am[/ch]
Junior paints that old cafe,
                                                    [ch]A#m[/ch]
He's gotta change those girls around.
[ch]Am[/ch]
Westbound drunk with lots to say,

But he never makes a sound.

Hustlers get what they deserve,
                                    [ch]A#m[/ch]
But its always half the date.
[ch]Am[/ch]
Good things come to those who wait,

Like an expiration date.


[Chorus]
[ch]Am[/ch]
See you around, I'll see you around
     [ch]G[/ch]
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
   [ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
I lead all your mind games astray.
[ch]Am[/ch]
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around,
     [ch]G[/ch]
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
       [ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray.
       [ch]Am[/ch]
Aww


[ch]Am[/ch]
Curb your tongue oh scallywag,
                                                [ch]A#m[/ch]
Because you got no flag to wave.
[ch]Am[/ch]
Save your breath for the black and white,

Every dog will have its day.


[Chorus:]
[ch]Am[/ch]
See you around, I'll see you around
     [ch]G[/ch]
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
   [ch]Em[/ch]                                      [ch]Dm[/ch]
I lead all your mind games astray.
[ch]Am[/ch]
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around,
     [ch]G[/ch]
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight.
       [ch]Em[/ch]                                     [ch]Dm[/ch]         [ch]F[/ch]
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray.
            [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you arou-hound!

     [ch]Em[/ch]
I'll see you around.
         [ch]Dm[/ch]                 [ch]F[/ch]
Goodbye and Hooray
            [ch]G[/ch]                            [ch]E[/ch]
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around oh nah nah nah no!
