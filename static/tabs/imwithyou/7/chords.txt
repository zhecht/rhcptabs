marcellus19: I think there s a Dm missing (every other line):
Em                  C               Dm - C
Tic-toc, I want to rock you like the 80s
  Em                     C
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed.
Em                  C        Dm - C
Tug boat sheila is into memorabilia
Em                  C
Who said three is a crowd?
We better get it on the go

...kind of funny that that isnt in any of the tabs... I believe it s right though

marcellus19: hmm the Dm - C should be on "80s" and "memoraBIlia" sorry for the formatting...

N_P.E.: @Marcellus, I don't think the Dm should be there, perhaps in a basstab?
