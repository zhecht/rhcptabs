[Intro]

F C | G Am | F C | G Dm/A
F C | G Am | F C | G
Am7 | Am7 | Am7 | Am7


[Verse 1]

Am7
They come from ev'ry state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined.
Tell the man, what did you have in mind?
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine,
No learning while you're in the line.
I'll take you to the broken sign.
You see these lights are blue.


[Bridge]

A9
Come and get it,
Lost it at the city limit.
Say goodbye
'Cause they will find a way to trim it.
Ev'rybody
Lookin' for a silly gimmick.
Gotta, get away,
Can't take it for another minute.

   
[Verse 2]   

Am7
This town is made of many things,
Just look at what the current brings.
So high, it's only promising.
This place was made on you.


[Chorus 1]

F          C    G            Am
  Tell me, baby, what's your story?
F           C
Where you come from
     G               Dm
And where you wanna go this time?
 F            C    G         Am
  Oh, tell me, lover, are you lonely?
F              C
The thing we need is
G7
Never all that hard to find.
F            C   G             Am
Oh, tell me, baby, what's your story?
F              C
  Where do you come from
     G               Dm
 And where you wanna go this time?
F             C     G         Am
Oh, you're so lovely. Are you lonely,
F        C     G7
  Giving up on the innocence you left behind?


[Verse 3]

Am7      
Some claim to have the fortitude
To shrewd to blow the interlude,
Sustaining pain to set a mood,
Step out to be renewed.
I'll move you like a baritone,
Jungle Brothers on the microphone.
Getting over with an undertone.
It's time to turn to stone.


[Bridge 2]

A9
Chitty, chitty baby,
When your nose is in the nitty gritty.
Life could be a little sweet,
But life could be a little shitty.
What a pity,
Boston and a Kansas City.
Looking for a hundred,
But you only ever found a fitty.


[Verse 4]

Am7
Three fingers in the honeycomb,
You ring just like a xylophone.
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home.


[Chorus 2]

F          C    G            Am
  Tell me, baby, what's your story?
F           C
Where you come from
     G               Dm
And where you wanna go this time?
 F            C    G         Am
  Oh, tell me, lover, are you lonely?
F              C
The thing we need is
G7
Never all that hard to find.
F            C   G             Am
Oh, tell me, baby, what's your story?
F              C
  Where do you come from
     G               Dm
 And where you wanna go this time?
F             C     G         Am
Oh, you're so lovely. Are you lonely,
F        C     G7
  Giving up on the innocence you left behind?

  
[Solo]


[Chorus 3]

F          C    G            Am
  Tell me, baby, what's your story?
F           C
Where you come from
     G               Dm
And where you wanna go this time?
 F            C    G         Am
  Oh, tell me, lover, are you lonely?
F              C
The thing we need is
G7
Never all that hard to find.
F            C   G             Am
Oh, tell me, baby, what's your story?
F              C
  Where do you come from
     G               Dm
 And where you wanna go this time?
F             C     G         Am
Oh, you're so lovely. Are you lonely,
F        C     G7
  Giving up on the innocence you left behind?
