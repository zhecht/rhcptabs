[Intro]
D  G  A  G

[Verse 1]
D
Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
G
Coming up strong at the animal bar
A
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
G
Turn another page at the animal bar
       D
And it won't be long
       G
No, it won't be long
       A
No, it won't be long
           G
Because it can't be long


[Pre-Chorus]
D
I I I the cry of isolation
A
I I I the high of meditation
G
I I I for sweet precipitation
D
I I I the high of deprivation
       D
And it won't be long
       A
No, it won't be long
       G
No, it won't be long
           D
Because it can't be long


[Chorus]
Bm
Rain on my frustration
Em
Stake my claim now break this
Bm
Wash me down my station
Em
Make more rain forsaken
Bm
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
Em
(1,2,3 lets break this)
Bm
Runnin' through the mud I gotta a feeling of worth
Em
(1,2,3 forsake this)
D  G  A  G


[Verse 2]
D
All aboard the ship cause you're gonna need an ark
         G
When the wet comes down you'll be swimming like a shark
A
Mopping up the pain and I'm a little older
G
Right as rain at the animal bar
       D
And it won't be long
       G
No, it won't be long
       A
No, it won't be long
           D
Because it can't be long


[Pre-Chorus]
D
I I I the cry of isolation
A
I I I the high of meditation
G
I I I for sweet precipitation
D
I I I the high of deprivation
       D
And it won't be long
       A
No, it won't be long
       G
No, it won't be long
           D
Because it can't be long

[Bridge]
Bm             A             G   D
Raindrops will fall from the sky
Bm             A               G   D
Stealing their shape from your eye
Bm         A            G    D
Now we can all get some sleep
    Bm                          A                  G   D
The water, the water, the water saving us from the heat
Bm               A            G    D
Some things will die in their place
Bm          A            G    D
Others will leave little trace
Bm        A             G    D
Fire will come find its day
    Bm                          A              G   D
The water, the water, the water washing it all away
