[Verse 1]
 [ch]A[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
If I had a clue I'd know exactly what to do
 [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
If I were the wiser of the two
 [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
And if I saw it all so clear I'd write it down and bend your ear
 [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
If I were the wiser of the two

[ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]           
We could take a walk into the canyons of fifth avenue
[ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Sing and dance just to name a few

[Chorus]
[ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
All I do (x2)

[Verse]
 [ch]A[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
If I heard the angels sing I'd sing it back to you and bring the
[ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
Sound of heaven ringing just for you
[ch]A[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]A[/ch]
And if I saw the sun fall down I'd pick it up and make a crown
[ch]D[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]
One that was a perfect fit for you

[ch]E[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]           
We could take a walk into the apple orchard by the school
[ch]E[/ch]                          [ch]A[/ch]
We could make a little residue 
[ch]E[/ch]                                  [ch]A[/ch]
We could find a place to stay, a secret little hideaway 
[ch]E[/ch]                              [ch]A[/ch]
Spend a little time inside of you

[Chorus]
[ch]F[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch]
All I do (x2)

[Bridge]
[ch]F[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
All eyes (x2)
[ch]F[/ch]    [ch]E[/ch]       [ch]D[/ch]
All eyes on you
[ch]F[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
All I do (x4)
