Sommerregen: Sounds great!

Sommerregen: Sounds great!

facebookmailitai: at the final bridge there's should be Dm instead of D, and instead of the A as well

[Verse 1]
 A           E             A
If I had a clue I'd know exactly what to do
 D             E            A
If I were the wiser of the two
 A               E                 A
And if I saw it all so clear I'd write it down and bend your ear
 D             E            A
If I were the wiser of the two

E                               A           
We could take a walk into the canyons of fifth avenue
E                              A
Sing and dance just to name a few

[Chorus]
F   G A
All I do (x2)

[Verse]
 A                 E             A
If I heard the angels sing I'd sing it back to you and bring the
D                  E             A
Sound of heaven ringing just for you
A                  E                 A
And if I saw the sun fall down I'd pick it up and make a crown
D                E             A
One that was a perfect fit for you

E                               A           
We could take a walk into the apple orchard by the school
E                          A
We could make a little residue 
E                                  A
We could find a place to stay, a secret little hideaway 
E                              A
Spend a little time inside of you

[Chorus]
F   G A
All I do (x2)

[Bridge]
F     E
All eyes (x2)
F    E       D
All eyes on you
F     A
All I do (x4)
