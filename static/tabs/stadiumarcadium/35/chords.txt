leo-sk8er: The bridge part is wrong, it must be something like
F - C - Gm - Bb

Many of the chords in the tabs for this song are incorrect. I believe these are the 
you use to play the song.

Intro: Bb F Gm F (Second F in this sequnce is played: xxx565 )

Bb                      F
It must have been your funny face

  Gm                       F
It must have been your laugh

Bb                      F
