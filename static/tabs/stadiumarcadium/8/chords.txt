Capo 1

[ch]Am[/ch] [ch]F[/ch]

[Verse:]
  [ch]Am[/ch]
Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all I want it bad
[ch]F[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]
Oh-oh
              [ch]F[/ch]
It's what I know

   [ch]Am[/ch]
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
      [ch]F[/ch] [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
Let's go    It's what I know

[Chorus:]
[ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Torture me and torture me
         [ch]F[/ch]            [ch]Dm[/ch]
they're forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
They're forcin' me so torture me, please

[Verse:]
[ch]Am[/ch]
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go
It's what I know

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please

     [ch]C[/ch]
The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill
      [ch]Dm[/ch]
Let's go...

Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound
Is so....

All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go...

A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
It's so....OH-oh-oh

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please

Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me, please
Torture me with sorcery
Forcin' me so torture me, please
