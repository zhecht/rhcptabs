MnW: Can the one who rated this with 1 star please tell me whats wrong with this tab? Corrections plz.

cannabiscrazy: the ground work is good as the chords are correct and you may be able to work out the song from it. but the layout of the tab is poor, the lyric work is awfull. and you would not be able to use this tab as a guide to playing the song.

G       D       Em      Bm

   G
My shadow side, so amplified

treating me like Benzedrine

Automatic laughter from a pro

could not compare to your routine

Ballorama beauty going toe to toe

I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
E
Mother, the father, the daughter

Right on the verge of one more dose

My theory isn't perfect but it's close
    G
I'm almost there, why should I care
   D
My heart is hurting when I share
Em                        Bm
Someone opened up, let it show
