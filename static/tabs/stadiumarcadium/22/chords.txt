Notes: I am not the original tabber. This is an update to version 1 to 
include the bridge and correct song structure.

[Intro]
[ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]Bm[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]  [ch]G[/ch]  [x2]

[Verse 1]
[ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]Bm[/ch]
She's the one, she's the only one
[ch]C[/ch]                            [ch]G[/ch]
She's got ripped back light, Gonna make me come
       [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
I say, when I smile, I'm a really smile
      [ch]C[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
I got dreams so wide, like a country mile
       [ch]Em[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]
I said now, I'll take it
     [ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]
It's better for you
    [ch]Em[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch]
Somehow, we'll make it
       [ch]C[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
'cause that's what we do

[Verse 2]
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me, and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire, jump up to meet
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it
'cause that's what we do

[Chorus]
[ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Something out there
      [ch]Em[/ch]           [ch]C[/ch]
Where love is your only friend and
[ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
We are the ones
          [ch]Em[/ch]            [ch]C[/ch]
That will make you feel better and
[ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
Someone to spare
     [ch]Em[/ch]               [ch]C[/ch]
When love is the only end and
[ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]
We are the ones
     [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
That will make you feel better

[Verse 3]
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth and a pack of style
I say, she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done, and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars make a diagram, and

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[ch]D[/ch]     [ch]Em[/ch]     [ch]C[/ch]       [ch]Am[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Oh... Yeah.. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah

[Verse 4]
So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind for the red on rust, I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it
'cause that's what we do

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]C[/ch]
We are the ones, that will make you feel better  (x4)

Blackmood: The Bm must be above ONLY ;)

like this:

Em                       Bm
She's the one, she's the only one

nbish11: @Blackmood Nice catch. Fixed.
