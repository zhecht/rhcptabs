Blackmood: The Bm must be above ONLY ;)

like this:

Em                       Bm
She's the one, she's the only one

nbish11: @Blackmood Nice catch. Fixed.

Notes: I am not the original tabber. This is an update to version 1 to 
include the bridge and correct song structure.

[Intro]
Em  Bm  C  G  [x2]

[Verse 1]
Em                       Bm
She's the one, she's the only one
C                            G
She's got ripped back light, Gonna make me come
       Em                 Bm
I say, when I smile, I'm a really smile
      C                      G
I got dreams so wide, like a country mile
       Em        Bm
I said now, I'll take it
     C          G
It's better for you
    Em         Bm
Somehow, we'll make it
       C              G
'cause that's what we do

[Verse 2]
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me, and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire, jump up to meet
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it
'cause that's what we do

[Chorus]
G             D
Something out there
      Em           C
Where love is your only friend and
G          D
We are the ones
          Em            C
That will make you feel better and
G          D
Someone to spare
     Em               C
When love is the only end and
G          D
We are the ones
     Em                 C
That will make you feel better

[Verse 3]
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth and a pack of style
I say, she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done, and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars make a diagram, and

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
D     Em     C       Am      C
Oh... Yeah.. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah

[Verse 4]
So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind for the red on rust, I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it
'cause that's what we do

[Chorus]

[Outro]
G          D          Em                 C
We are the ones, that will make you feel better  (x4)
