Hustle, bustle and so much muscle awww
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Cells about to seperate
And I find it hard to concentrate and

[Verse 2]

[ch]Em[/ch]
Death defying this mess I'm buying
     [ch]Bm[/ch]
It's raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate and

[ch]Em[/ch]
Estuary is blessed but scary your
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Heart's about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate and

[ch]C[/ch]      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]

[ch]C[/ch]     [ch]G[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]

[ch]C[/ch]       [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
Do you want me to show up for duty and
[ch]C[/ch]          [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Em[/ch]

My lone ranger the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure eight
And I'll do my best to recreate and

Sweet precision and soft collision aww
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to seperate and
