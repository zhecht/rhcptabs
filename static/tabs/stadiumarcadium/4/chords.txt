                       STADIUM ARCADIUM

[Verse]

F#m                                A
Bells around St. Petersburg when I saw you
  F#m                             A               E
I hope I get what you deserve and this is where I find
F#m                                      A
Smoke surround your perfect face and I´m falling
F#m                                A               E
Pushing a broom out into space and this is where I find a way


[Chorus]

    Bm                 D
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          A
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    E
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
Bm
Stranger things have happened both
  D
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          A
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
E                                           F#m
Pushing myself and no I don´t mind asking...now


[Verse]

 F#m                                 A
Alone inside my forest room and it´s storming
  F#m                               A               E
I never thought I´d be in bloom but this is where I start
F#m
Derelict days and the stereo plays

For the all night crowd that it cannot phase
        A
and I´m calling
F#m
Tedious weeds that the media breeds

But the animal gets what the animal needs
        A
And I´m sorry


[Chorus]

    Bm                 D
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          A      
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    E
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
Bm
Stranger things have happened both
  D
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          A
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
E                                           F#m
Pushing myself and no I don´t mind asking...now


[Bridge]
    A               E
And this is where I find

F#m                                A
Rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
F#m                        A               E
Kind enough to disavow and this is where I stand


[Chorus]

    Bm                 D   
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          A
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    E
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
Bm 
Stranger things have happened both
  D
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          A
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
E
Pushing myself and no I don´t mind asking

    Bm                 D
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          A
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    E
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
Bm
Stranger things have happened both
  D
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          A                          E
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming to you
