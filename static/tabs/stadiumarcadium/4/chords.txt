                       STADIUM ARCADIUM

[Verse]

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
Bells around St. Petersburg when I saw you
  [ch]F#m[/ch]                             [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
I hope I get what you deserve and this is where I find
[ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]A[/ch]
Smoke surround your perfect face and I´m falling
[ch]F#m[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Pushing a broom out into space and this is where I find a way


[Chorus]

    [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    [ch]E[/ch]
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Stranger things have happened both
  [ch]D[/ch]
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
[ch]E[/ch]                                           [ch]F#m[/ch]
Pushing myself and no I don´t mind asking...now


[Verse]

 [ch]F#m[/ch]                                 [ch]A[/ch]
Alone inside my forest room and it´s storming
  [ch]F#m[/ch]                               [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
I never thought I´d be in bloom but this is where I start
[ch]F#m[/ch]
Derelict days and the stereo plays

For the all night crowd that it cannot phase
        [ch]A[/ch]
and I´m calling
[ch]F#m[/ch]
Tedious weeds that the media breeds

But the animal gets what the animal needs
        [ch]A[/ch]
And I´m sorry


[Chorus]

    [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          [ch]A[/ch]      
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    [ch]E[/ch]
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Stranger things have happened both
  [ch]D[/ch]
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
[ch]E[/ch]                                           [ch]F#m[/ch]
Pushing myself and no I don´t mind asking...now


[Bridge]
    [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
And this is where I find

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                [ch]A[/ch]
Rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
[ch]F#m[/ch]                        [ch]A[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Kind enough to disavow and this is where I stand


[Chorus]

    [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]   
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    [ch]E[/ch]
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
[ch]Bm[/ch] 
Stranger things have happened both
  [ch]D[/ch]
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
[ch]E[/ch]
Pushing myself and no I don´t mind asking

    [ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]
The stadium arcadium a mirror to the moon(a mirror to the moon)
          [ch]A[/ch]
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming
    [ch]E[/ch]
The state of the art until the clouds come crashing
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Stranger things have happened both
  [ch]D[/ch]
Before and afternoon(before and afternoon)
          [ch]A[/ch]                          [ch]E[/ch]
Well, I´m forming and I´m warming to you


Enjoy it. Please rate it.
