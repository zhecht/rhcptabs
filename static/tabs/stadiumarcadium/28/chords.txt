    Am                      G        F                    E

bear careless turnip snare rampages, pitch color pages...
         Am               G
Down and out but not in Vegas,
     F              E               Am
Disembarks and disengages. No loft.
           G            F
Sweet pink canary cages plummet
            E
Pop dewskin fortitude for the
Am
sniffing black noses
     G               F             E
That snort and allude to dangling trinkets
          Am                  G
That mimic the dirt cough go drink its.
     F        E
It's for you.
                    Am
Blue battered naval town slip kisses
   G              F                        E
Delivered by duck muscles and bottle-nosed grifters
 Am               G
Arrive in time to catch the late show.
       Am
It's a beehive barrel race.
  G                  F           E
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature
              Am                   G
Who tried and failed to reach her.
            F                 E
Embossed beneath a box in the closet. That's lost.
                  Am                   G               F
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
                    E                   Am
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters
         G                     F
Into new morning milk blanket.
          E                  Am
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch
     G              F                E                    Am
Bunny whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay.
          G                  F                      E                 Am
Get your broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles...away...
