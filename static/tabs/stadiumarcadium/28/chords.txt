[Outro]
[ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]G[/ch]
  She's got a sword in case
       [ch]F[/ch]               [ch]E[/ch]
Though this is not her lord in case
    [ch]Am[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]F[/ch]                    [ch]E[/ch]
The one who can't afford to face her image is restored to grace.
     [ch]Am[/ch]
Disappeared,
    [ch]G[/ch]
No trace.
       [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]
Musky tears, suitcase.
              [ch]Am[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]
The down turn brave little burn cub
              [ch]F[/ch]                  [ch]E[/ch]
bear careless turnip snare rampages, pitch color pages...
         [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Down and out but not in Vegas,
     [ch]F[/ch]              [ch]E[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Disembarks and disengages. No loft.
           [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]F[/ch]
Sweet pink canary cages plummet
            [ch]E[/ch]
Pop dewskin fortitude for the
[ch]Am[/ch]
sniffing black noses
     [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]             [ch]E[/ch]
That snort and allude to dangling trinkets
          [ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
That mimic the dirt cough go drink its.
     [ch]F[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
It's for you.
                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Blue battered naval town slip kisses
   [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                        [ch]E[/ch]
Delivered by duck muscles and bottle-nosed grifters
 [ch]Am[/ch]               [ch]G[/ch]
Arrive in time to catch the late show.
       [ch]Am[/ch]
It's a beehive barrel race.
  [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]           [ch]E[/ch]
A shehive stare and chase wasted feature
              [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]
Who tried and failed to reach her.
            [ch]F[/ch]                 [ch]E[/ch]
Embossed beneath a box in the closet. That's lost.
                  [ch]Am[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]               [ch]F[/ch]
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
                    [ch]E[/ch]                   [ch]Am[/ch]
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters
         [ch]G[/ch]                     [ch]F[/ch]
Into new morning milk blanket.
          [ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]Am[/ch]
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch
     [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]F[/ch]                [ch]E[/ch]                    [ch]Am[/ch]
Bunny whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay.
          [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]F[/ch]                      [ch]E[/ch]                 [ch]Am[/ch]
Get your broom and sweep the echoes of yesternights fallen freckles...away...
