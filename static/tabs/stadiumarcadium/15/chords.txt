m_daly_123: thanks man..great tab...the last one's chorus was all messed up...awesome song

frgttn1: man the chorus is completely wrong . i think the second versions chorus is more correct than yours


Hi guys,
I sort of had to write down this song in the album version with the correct words and chords.
So here it is, it's kinda like just the chord version great for playing on the acoustic.
I didn't write down the 'solo' riffs don't blame me for that plz . I also put some bars
so that you guys can see a bit of a rhythm.

[Intro]
| C#m/G#  | C#m/G# (B)| E       | E    (B)|

[Verse 1]
Em           |D    C
All alone not by myself
Em              |D      C
Another girl bad for my health
Em                      |D       C
I've seen it all through someone else, and I
Em               |D      C
(Another girl bad for my health)

Em            |D    C
Celebrated but undisturbed
Em              |D      C
Serenaded by the terror bird
Em                       |D     C
It's seldom seen and it's never heard, oh
Em               |D      C    |Em
(Serenaded by the terror bird)

[Chorus]
      D            |A            E
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
E   D             |A           E
Desecration is the smile on my face
E        D            |A           E
The love I made is the shape of my space
E  D        |A
My face, my face

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Em                  |D      C
Disintegrated by the rising sun
Em                    |D     C
A rolling black out of oblivion
Em                                 |D      C
And I'd like to think that I'm your number one, I'm
Em                     |D     C
(A rolling black out of oblivion)

Em                 |D        C
I wanna leave but I just get stuck
Em                     |D      C
A broken record runnin' low on luck
Em                        |D         C
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
Em                                |D      C     |Em
And I'm a (a broken record runnin' low on luck)

[Chorus]
      D           |A             E
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
E   D             |A           E
Desecration is the smile on my face
E        D            |A           E
The love I made is the shape of my space
E  D        |A
My face, my face

[Bridge]
| C  G  | E    | C  G  | E    |

C            G
We could out all go down to
E
Malibu and make some noise
C                 G      E
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys
C            G
We could all come up with
E
Something new to be destroyed
C               Em
We could all go down

| Em   | D  C  | Em   | D  C  |

[Verse]
Em                        |D      C
I love the feeling when it falls apart
Em                        |D        C
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Em                          |D      C
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
      Em                       |D        C     |Em
And I'm (Slow to finish but I'm quick to start)

[Chorus] (x2)
      D           |A             E
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
E   D             |A           E
Desecration is the smile on my face
E        D            |A           E
The love I made is the shape of my space
E  D       |A
My face my face
