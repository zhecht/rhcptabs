Won't somebody come along
Bb6                         Abmaj7
And teach me how to keep it alive,
           Bb6    Cm
To survive?
                           Bb6
Come along and show me something
                     Abmaj7

Take away the tourniquet

All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
                       Bb6              Abmaj7
But now you're quick to get into your regret
                                                Bb6 Cm
I'll take a fall and now you got to give it all away
