bappy: I found some difficulty, i used this tab to transcribe to piano.

trouble is, it has been written as Em, G, A2 and C. This is because it is cappoed at 6, the chords you strum are actually 3 whole tones higher. the song is actually bBm, bD, bE2 and bG. hope this helps anyone who is as easily confused as me :)

jdk064: great song and great tab.sound man!!! Im off to play it


*Jordie1*: great work I dunno wat 'bappy' is talking about. I found it easy to play. great
