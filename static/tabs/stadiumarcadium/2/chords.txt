[Verse]

   Em                      C
   Come to decide that the things that I tried  
         G               D
    Were in my life just to get high on.  
Em                    C
    When I sit alone, come, get a little known,  
    G                      D
    But I need more than myself this time.  
    Em                        C
    Step from the road to the sea to the sky,  
          G               D
    And I do believe what we rely on.  
Em                   C                         G                D
    When I lay it on, come, get to play it on, all my life to sacrifice. 


[Chorus] 

    Em   C  -   G        D      Em   C  - G - D
    Hey oh,       listen what I say, oh.  
                Em   C   - G              D      Em   C   - G - D
    I got your, hey oh,        now listen what I say, oh.  


[Verse] 

   Em                   C
   When  will know that really can’t go  
           G                  D
    To the well one more time to decide on.  
Em                        C
    When it’s killing me, when will really see,  
    G                  D
    All that I need to look inside ?
    Em                     C
    Come to believe that I better not leave,  
      G             D
    Before I get my chance to ride.  
Em                        C
    When it’s killing me, what do I really need,  
    G                  D
    All that I need to look inside ?

  
[Chorus]
 
    Em   C  - G          D      Em   C  - G - D
    Hey oh,       listen what I say, oh.  
                   Em  C   - G             D      Em   C   - G - D
    Come back and, hey oh,         look at what I say, oh. 

 
[Bridge]

    C
The more I see, the less I know,  
    Am                        Em  C
The more I like to let it go, hey oh, oh oh oh.                      

G                           D
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder,  
           Am
Where it’s so white as snow.  
G                      D
Privately divided by a world so undecided,  
            Am
And there’s nowhere to go.  
G                         D
In between the cover of another perfect wonder,  
           Am
Where it’s so white as snow.  
G                                      D
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed,
            Am
And there’s nowhere to go.

[Verse]

   Em                 C
   When to descend to amend for a friend,  
            G                  D
    All the channels that have broken down.  
Em                       C
    Now you bring it up, I’m gonna ring it up,  
    G                D
    Just to hear you sing it out.  
    Em                        C
    Step from the road to the sea to the sky,  

          G               D
    And I do believe what we rely on.  
Em                    C                        G                D
    When I lay it on, come, get to play it on, all my life to sacrifice.

    The more I like to let it go, hey oh, oh oh oh.  

G                          D
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder,  
           Am
Where it’s so white as snow.  
G                      D
Privately divided by a world so undecided,  
            Am
And there’s nowhere to go.  
G                       D
In between the cover of another perfect wonder,  
           Am
Where it’s so white as snow.  
G                                      D
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed,

And there’s nowhere to go.
