[Verse]

D
40 detectives this week,
D
40 detectives strong,
D
Takin' a stroll down Love Street,
D
Strollin' is that so wrong,
D
Can I get my co-defendant


[Pre-chorus]

D
Hump de bump doop bodu,
D
Bump de hump doop bop,
D
Hump de bump doop bodu,
D
Bump de hump doop bodu,
D
Hump de bump doop bop,
D
Bump de hump doop bodu,
D
Bump bump


[Chorus]

Dm  
  It Must have been a hundred miles,
Bb 
  Any of a hundred styles,
A                      G
 It's not about the smile you wear,
Bb               C
  But the way we make out
Dm
  When I was an all-aloner,
Bb  
  Nothin' but a two beach comber,
A        G                Bb
 Anybody seen the sky? I'm,
         C
I'm wide awake now


[Verse]

D
Workin' the beat as we speak,
D
Workin' the belle du monde,
D
Believe in the havoc we wreak,
D
Believin', is that so wrong,
D
Can I get my co-dependent


[Pre-chorus]

D
Hump de bump doop bodu,
D
Bump de hump doop bop,
D
Hump de bump doop bodu,
D
Bump de hump doop bodu,
D
Hump de bump doop bop,
D
Bump de hump doop bodu,
D
Bump bump


[Chorus]

Dm  
  It Must have been a hundred miles,
Bb 
  Any of a hundred styles,
A                      G
 It's not about the smile you wear,
Bb               C
  But the way we make out
Dm
  When I was an all-aloner,
Bb  
  Nothin' but a two beach comber,
A        G                Bb
 Anybody seen the sky? I'm,
         C
I'm wide awake now


[Pre-chorus]

D
Hump de bump doop bodu,
D
Bump de hump doop bop,
D
Hump de bump doop bodu,
D
Bump de hump doop bodu,
D
Hump de bump doop bop,
D
Bump de hump doop bodu,
D
Bump bump


[Chorus]

Dm
  Listen to me what I said,
Bb
  Try to get it through your head,
A                G               Bb
 A little bit of circumstance and
            C
A chance to make out
Dm                   
  Livin' in a citadel,
Bb
  It's hard enough to be yourself,
A                  G
 Waiting for the bell to toll,
Bb              C
  And I'm wide awake now

Dm                                
  It Must have been a hundred miles,
Bb
  Any of a hundred styles,
A                      G
 It's not about the smile you wear,
Bb               C
  But the way we make out
Dm
  When I was all-aloner,
Bb
 Nothin' but a two beach comber,
A         G               Bb
 Anybody seen the sky? I'm,
           C      D
I'm wide awake now
