renanmp91: On the chorus, there is some mistakes. The correct order is:
 Am G C  /   Am D Em  /  Am  G  C  /  Am  D  Em

Am             D                      G
Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
                C           Am
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
     D                   Em
LA's screaming you're my home
Am        D                       G
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
                   C
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Am            D                      Em 
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there


[Pre-Chorus]
G                Am
    I don't know but it's been said
D                              G        
    Your heart is stronger than your head
C                D              Em
    And this location is my home

Stick n move you're living in a quick world
              C
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Am        D                Em
   Born into it that's for sure


[Chorus]
Am            D                G                  C
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Am                 D       Em   
Sick love comes to wash us away
Am             D
Prisons of perspective
         G              C
How your vision gets corrected and
Am           D                Em
Sick love is my modern cliche

People talk and tell you what you want to hear
                C
Do you really need another souvenir
Am           D             Em  
Super heroes tend to disappear 
Am             D                      G
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
                  C                       Am
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
                   D                   Em
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

    I don't know but it's been said
D                              G
