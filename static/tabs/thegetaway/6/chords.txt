[Verse 1]
[ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
                [ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Am[/ch]
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
     [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
LA's screaming you're my home
[ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
                   [ch]C[/ch]
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
[ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]Em[/ch] 
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there


[Pre-Chorus]
[ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
    I don't know but it's been said
[ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]        
    Your heart is stronger than your head
[ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
    And this location is my home


[Verse 2]
[ch]Am[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
              [ch]C[/ch]
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
[ch]Am[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
   Born into it that's for sure


[Chorus]
[ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
[ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]   
Sick love comes to wash us away
[ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]
Prisons of perspective
         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
How your vision gets corrected and
[ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Sick love is my modern cliche


[Verse 3]
[ch]Am[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]                        [ch]G[/ch]
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
                [ch]C[/ch]
Do you really need another souvenir
[ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]Em[/ch]  
Super heroes tend to disappear 
[ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                      [ch]G[/ch]
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
                  [ch]C[/ch]                       [ch]Am[/ch]
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
                   [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Em[/ch]
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last


[Pre-Chorus]
[ch]G[/ch]                [ch]Am[/ch]
    I don't know but it's been said
[ch]D[/ch]                              [ch]G[/ch]         
    Your heart is stronger than your head
[ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]
    And this location is my home


[Chorus]
[ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]                  [ch]C[/ch]
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
[ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]   
Sick love comes to wash us away
[ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Prisons of perspective
         [ch]G[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
How your vision gets corrected and
[ch]Am[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch]
Sick love is my modern cliche

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
[ch]Am[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]   
Sick love comes to wash us away
[ch]Am[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]
Prisons of perspective

[Outro]
[ch]Am[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]C[/ch]
Openly defective is the lover you elected and
[ch]Am[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
A portrait she was bound to portray

renanmp91: On the chorus, there is some mistakes. The correct order is:
 Am G C  /   Am D Em  /  Am  G  C  /  Am  D  Em

mmwheeler: Chorus corrected per renanmp91 comment.

noviceguitar94: strumming pattern anyone? :) i guess D DU U DU would be suitable, wouldn´t it? :) thanks for anything

i am just confused by the "dreaming is a Petibon", cause it´s kinda faster
