Listen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon, we got high
  [ch]G#m[/ch]                                                       [ch]B[/ch]
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space, too much pride
  [ch]G#m[/ch]                                                       [ch]B[/ch]
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut, Soviet Spy
  [ch]G#m[/ch]                                                       [ch]B[/ch]
Every now and then when I remember to befriend, the little things in life

[Chorus]
[ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
Hey you're fine
        [ch]B[/ch]
I wanna listen to the radio
[ch]F#[/ch]                    [ch]C#m[/ch]
Driving down Calexico highway
[ch]E[/ch]                  [ch]G#m[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]
And now I know the signs for sure

[ch]C#m[/ch]     [ch]E[/ch]
Hold my hand
          [ch]B[/ch]
I want to share it all with Mary

Later on I'll read to you the things that I've been needing to say goodbye
[ch]G#m[/ch]                                                         [ch]B[/ch]
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had, tell no lies
[ch]G#m[/ch]                                                          [ch]B[/ch]
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off 'fore you die
[ch]G#m[/ch]                                                           [ch]B[/ch]
Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is so much sky

[Chorus]
[ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
Hey you're fine

Skinny brains and little stains upon your
                     [ch]B[/ch]  
Face teenage remains tell me more
[ch]G#m[/ch]                                                          [ch]B[/ch]
Lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

[Chorus]
[ch]C#m[/ch]        [ch]E[/ch]
Hey you're fine
