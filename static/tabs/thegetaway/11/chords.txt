dquill5: I found for the verses G#m then F# then E works a lot better

camac1: Agreed, for me it's G#m, F#, E, E

[Verse]
  G#m                                                       B
Listen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon, we got high
  G#m                                                       B
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space, too much pride
  G#m                                                       B
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut, Soviet Spy
  G#m                                                       B
Every now and then when I remember to befriend, the little things in life

[Chorus]
C#m        E
Hey you're fine
        B
I wanna listen to the radio
F#                    C#m
Driving down Calexico highway
E                  G#m       B
And now I know the signs for sure

C#m     E
Hold my hand
          B
I want to share it all with Mary
F#                     C#m
Results are gonna vary now

[Verse]
G#m                                                            B
Later on I'll read to you the things that I've been needing to say goodbye
G#m                                                         B
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had, tell no lies
G#m                                                          B
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off 'fore you die
G#m                                                           B
Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is so much sky

[Chorus]
C#m        E
Hey you're fine
        B
I wanna listen to the radio
F#                    C#m
Driving down Calexico highway
E                  G#m       B
And now I know the signs for sure

C#m     E
Hold my hand
          B
I want to share it all with Mary
F#                     C#m
Results are gonna vary now

[Verse]
G#m
Skinny brains and little stains upon your
                     B  
Face teenage remains tell me more
G#m                                                          B
Lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

[Chorus]
C#m        E
Hey you're fine
        B
I wanna listen to the radio
F#                    C#m
Driving down Calexico highway
E                  G#m       B
And now I know the signs for sure

C#m     E
Hold my hand
          B
I want to share it all with Mary
F#                     C#m
