spaceage65: Good job!! I saw the other tab from...and totally wrong.
But you nailed it! Btw...I dropped the low E to a D. Gives it more umph!
Just my opinion and for shits and giggles :-)
PEACE!

Dezai: Yeah I think Josh plays this song in Drop D. It gives it the beefier sound you hear on the record.

[Verse]
Dm7               G5
   Standing naked in your kitchen
Dm7                 G5
   Feeling free that I could be alive
Dm7               G5
   Clearly I'm a contradiction
Dm7                  G5
   Too young to be my wife

Dm7                    G5
   A peaceful storm is never hectic
Dm7                     G5
   Her mellow voice that I could be within
Dm7               G5
   The uniform is anorexic
Dm7                     G5
   A jealous choice won't win

[Pre-Chorus]
         Dm7
   A metamorphosis samurai
         Dm7
   Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
         Dm7
   Metamorphosis samurai

[Verse]
Dm7                        G5
   Paint your face 'cause I'm a black foot
Dm7                    G5
   I thought I counted up the fireflies
Dm7                G5
   Close enough to get a good look
Dm7               G5
   Time to mobilize

[Pre-Chorus]
         Dm7
   A metamorphosis samurai

         Dm7
   Metamorphosis samurai

[Chorus]
Bb
   I'm a lonely lad
          C
   I've lost myself out on the range
Eb
   I don't remember much
       Gm                 C
   So don't ask me I've gone insane

[Verse]
Dm7              G5
   Taking acid in a graveyard
Dm7                   G5
   Stealing food to keep the night alive
Dm7               G5
   Every day I try to play hard
Dm7            G5
   Even with my lies
Dm7                        G5
   The day they found you on a tour bus
Dm7                     G5
   The news was barren as a desert bone
Dm7                       G5
   The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
Dm7                 G5
   A couple pictures shown

[Chorus]
Bb
   I'm a lonely lad
          C
   I've lost myself out on the range
Eb
   I don't remember much
        Gm                 C
   So don't ask me I've gone insane

[Verse]
Dm7               G5
   Slowly turning into driftwood
Dm7               G5
   No one ever wants to die alone
Dm7                 G5
   Thinking that a pretty gift could
Dm7                G5
   Make you less unknown
Dm7                 G5
   Dirty sneakers on the pavement
Dm7                       G5
   The brilliant features of a common man
Dm7              G5
   See the miracle of your life
Dm7           G5
   No one ever can

[Chorus]
Bb
   I'm a lonely lad
           C
   I've lost myself out on the range
Eb
   I don't remember much
       Gm                F
   So don't ask me I've gone insane
Bb
   See the world go by
            C
   The changes that we entertain
Eb
   I don't recall it all
        Gm            C
   Remember I have gone insane
