dvheereveld: Very nice, however you switched two parts in both choruses: "Maybe I'm the right one/Maybe I'm the wrong" and "Maybe you're my last love/Maybe you're my first"

-D

soaresvictor: You're right. I'll correct :)

Pholl1: 5* - Really nice job, but I think some of the A chords in the chorus could be Am (maybe all but the last one?)
