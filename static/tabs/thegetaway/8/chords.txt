[Intro]

 [ch]C#m[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]        x2


[Verse 1]

[ch]C#m[/ch]
I was walking through the streets 

[ch]B[/ch]                   [ch]A[/ch]
I could not hear my best friend call

[ch]C#m[/ch]
He was feeling incomplete 

    [ch]B[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]
about to take his final fall

[ch]C#m[/ch]
Last thing I remember there were 

[ch]B[/ch]                  [ch]A[/ch]
tears of blood and just not mine

[ch]C#m[/ch]
Any other day and I would 

N.C.
save you from this cold decline


[Chorus 1]

[ch]E[/ch]
Everything they said about everything

[ch]D[/ch]
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

[ch]E[/ch]
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

[ch]D[/ch]
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]G#7[/ch]
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah


The next dimension, show me in


[Interlude 1]

Intro Riff again

 [ch]C#m[/ch]       [ch]B[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]        x2

[Verse 2]

[ch]C#m[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
We were moving in the world, expanding your realities

[ch]C#m[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities

[ch]C#m[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
The Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears

[ch]C#m[/ch]                              [ch]B[/ch]          [ch]A[/ch]
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years


[Chorus 2]

[ch]E[/ch]
Everything they said about everything

[ch]D[/ch]
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

[ch]E[/ch]
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

[ch]D[/ch]
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]G#7[/ch]
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah


The next dimension, show me in


[Bridge]

F#sus2 is played (by the piano), but F#m is also fine to play in this context



   [ch]C#m[/ch]             [ch]G#7[/ch]             [ch]F#sus2[/ch]          [ch]E[/ch]



[ch]C#m[/ch]    
You get a little bit more this time when

    [ch]G#7[/ch]
You give a little bit for your brother's kind

[ch]F#m[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"


[ch]C#m[/ch]
You sing a little bit stronger when you

  [ch]G#7[/ch]
Remember the song of your old best friend

[ch]F#m[/ch]                         [ch]E[/ch]
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"


[Interlude 2]

[Chorus 3]

[ch]E[/ch]
Everything they said about everything

[ch]D[/ch]
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]C#m[/ch]
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

[ch]E[/ch]
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

[ch]D[/ch]
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue

[ch]F#m[/ch]                                      [ch]G#7[/ch]
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

Shwing it up: Transpose -2 and throw a capo on the second fret, makes it a bit easier.
