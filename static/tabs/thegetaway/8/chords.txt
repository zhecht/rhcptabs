Shwing it up: Transpose -2 and throw a capo on the second fret, makes it a bit easier.

[Intro]

 C#m       B     A        x2


[Verse 1]

C#m
I was walking through the streets 

B                   A
I could not hear my best friend call

C#m
He was feeling incomplete 

    B               A
about to take his final fall

C#m
Last thing I remember there were 

B                  A
tears of blood and just not mine

C#m
Any other day and I would 

N.C.
save you from this cold decline


[Chorus 1]

E
Everything they said about everything

D
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme

F#m                                      C#m
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

E
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

D
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue

F#m                                      G#7
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah


The next dimension, show me in


[Interlude 1]

Intro Riff again

 C#m       B     A        x2

[Verse 2]

C#m                              B          A
We were moving in the world, expanding your realities

C#m                              B          A
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities

C#m                              B          A
The Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears

C#m                              B          A
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years


[Chorus 2]

E
Everything they said about everything

D
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme

F#m                                      C#m
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

E
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

D
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue

F#m                                      G#7
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah


The next dimension, show me in


[Bridge]

F#sus2 is played (by the piano), but F#m is also fine to play in this context



   C#m             G#7             F#sus2          E



C#m    
You get a little bit more this time when

    G#7
You give a little bit for your brother's kind

F#m                         E
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"


C#m
You sing a little bit stronger when you

  G#7
Remember the song of your old best friend

F#m                         E
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"

Everything they said about everything

D
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme

F#m                                      C#m
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

E
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young

D
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue

F#m                                      G#7
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
