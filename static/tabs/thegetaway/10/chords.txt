KeeSe: How should i do Eb in this one? Like how is the chord played

[Intro]
C5 C5 Bb5 C5

[Verse 1]
C5                   C5                        Bb5                C5
   I met a man in a rock and roll band he said won't you come with me
C5                        C5                  Bb5             C5
   I let him know that I could not go you see I get mine for free

Eb                Bb              Ab
We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
Eb                    Bb              Ab
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite


[Chorus]
C5                  C5                     Bb5          C5
   Step inside the emotional ride I could use some company
C5                  C5               Bb5                 C5
     Illusionary is so damn scary I call my best friend Flea

Eb         Bb            Ab
This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Eb                Bb             Ab
Connected by the great unknown between us there are lines

[Chorus]
Cm     Ab
Yes I told her that
Bb       Eb
I'm the older cat
Ab                  B7
Can I scratch your back all day
G                   Bb7
I would not have it any other way, well

Cm        Ab
Means so much to me
Bb       Eb
Can you see the we
Ab           B7                G                   Bb7
What are we ever gonna do when all I want to be is next to you

[Verse 2]
C5                         C5                Bb5              C5
    I took a girl from the underworld and I held her way too tight
C5                      C5                   Bb5             C5
    When it's all been said and done she was not up for the fight

Eb                Bb              Ab
We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Eb             Bb               Ab
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind

[Chorus]
Cm      Ab
It's my favorite
Bb     Eb
So I savor it
Ab                  B7
I must report that life is short
G                     Bb7
So of your love I'll take ten quarts well

Cm          Ab
There's no end to this
Bb        Eb
Don't pretend to miss
Ab                B7               G            Bb7
You and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and

Cm     Ab
Am I crazy to
Bb        Eb
Join the lazy zoo
Ab               B7
All these human butterflies and
G                 Bb7
Cactus flowers swollen eyes and

Cm          Ab
I want the devil's share
Bb       Eb
Of you I do declare
Ab               B7
Again I'm asking can I do
G                       Bb7    G   G7   B7  Bb7 (not sure here)
When all these animals want to be just like you

[Verse 3]
C5                     C5                      Bb5          C5
    I met a girl with long black hair and she opened up so wide
C5                      C5               Bb5               C5
     A daffodil growing in Brazil and I picked her for my bride

Eb                Bb              Ab
We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
Eb                 Bb             Ab
And no one that I know has ever really done it right

[Outro]
          C5  C5
Done it right
          Bb5 C5
Done it right
          C5  C5
Done it right
          Bb5 C5
Done it right
