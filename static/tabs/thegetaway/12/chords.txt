whega: Lovely chords, but I think that the third line of the verse should go Dm G Am.
Also the B at the end of the chorus doesn't really sound right, maybe Am?

whega: (chords referred to capo at I)

chrisknutsen: The Chord is wrong at the end of lyrics "You're my Old Man in the SEA",  it should be F7.   C major is incorrect.

Bbm            Db            Eb         F
Woke up this morning like I always do

Strawberries left to decay

Voices that start to betray

Bb               Db                             Eb

I still like to think that there's hope

Strawberries left to decay

[Pre-chorus]
Bbm            Db           Eb       F
Struck by the sight of an empty hall

Voices that start to betray

The hunter gets hunted
