[Intro]
Am  D   C   F
G   C   F   G

[Verse 1]
Am                       D
Suicide a month before I met you
C                              F
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
G                               C
Somehow you made your way to my decade
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my girl

Am                              D
In the sun, I see you with your guard down
C                              F
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
G                                   C
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time

Am                        D
Overkill you took another red pill
C                               F
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
G                                C
We are the ones you want to know right now
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light

Am                          D
Come again to murder your report card
C                                F
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
G                            C
You are the one I want to be stuck with
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, big fight

[Pre Ð¡horus]
Am D   C   F
Fa vor some
G   C   F    G
Way too young
Am    D  C   F
Slave to none
G   C   F    G
Way too young

[Chorus]
Am             C
Say goodbye my love
F
I can see it in your soul
Am             C
Say goodbye my love
F
Thought that I could make you whole
Am       C     F
Let your lover sail
Am        C       F
Death was made to fail

[Verse 2]
Am                             D
Sticky fingers find the way to take her
C                           F
Crumple up another piece of paper
G                                     C
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, this life

Am                       D
Slip away into the solar system
C                                  F
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
G                                C
Some like it dark and now I know where to
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, find you

Am                             D
Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
C                         F
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
G                               C
Give up the ghost before you go under
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, wonder

Am                             D
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
C                              F
Watch me starve was never to impress you
G                                     C
I would have killed the part of me to have you
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, story

[Chorus]
Am             C
Say goodbye my love
F
I can see it in your soul
Am             C
Say goodbye my love
F
Thought that I could make you whole
Am       C     F
Let your lover sail
Am        C       F
Death was made to fail

[Bridge]
Em   Dm   Em   Dm
Em                     Dm
Babe I know love is a funny thing
Em                   Dm
Born to die in the eternal spring

[Verse 3]
Am                                  D
Your flickering is more than just a small flame
C                            F
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
G                                  C
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my bat

Am                     D
Suicide is never gonna save you
C                              F
When I cried, it was because I came too
G                              C
You are the one I want to know right now
F                G
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, kiss this
