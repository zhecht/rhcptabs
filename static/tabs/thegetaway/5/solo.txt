Not sure what effects Klinghoffer may be using if any. It's also important to note that while the rest of 
the  song is written in standard 4/4 timing, the solo portion is written in 12/8, meaning that each quarter 
note is divided up into groups of 3 eighth notes, as opposed to 2 eighth notes. Other than that all I can 
really  point out is that Klinghoffer plays somewhat sloppy on the album (though this was probably 
intentional, to give it a more rocky feel) and misses a few notes at times, luckily he somewhat compensates 
this in a really  neat way by having a second track with a different tone come in to pick up his slack, that 
being said the rhythm isn't exact, but just a general guide. Just play hard and loud and it will sound fine.

This pick up comes in on the 3rd beat of the 4th measure of the bass interlude before the guitar solo

thelosah36: It doesn't actually change time signatures. Rather, Josh and Flea play mostly triplets. You can tell by listening to the drums, which are still in 4/4. The tab is fine, though I would hit the 14th fret of the G three times rather than just once in that first half.

Dimitris_RHCP: Which is the second track with the different tone?

AlannaKelly: didn't like this contribution
