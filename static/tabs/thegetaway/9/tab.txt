soaresvictor: It's a good tab, if you want to make a great one here is what I think you should do: - Tab when a string is muted but still be played as a muted note in the main riff you can hear that Josh isn't alternating picking between the two E notes, in live perfomances he plays the E note on the D string and muting the A string giving that scratchy sound. And sometimes he plays fills like a slide from D note do E note or a grace note on G note.-In the Pre-chorus the progression isn't C G A (E) but C G D A (E).-I don't know if you can hear but in the Chorus there's some bends thru the chords and you only tabbed tonic and the third for each chords. Also you could display the chords above the tabbed so the beginners will understand better. So the progression consists in a Bm, Bb, D, F#m, G.-Display the exactly time starts each section.-There's some variations in the last Chorus with an addition of another guitar with a Wah pedal.-The "solo" is a simple pentatonic lick you can take easy, won't be a problem if you hear more closer.The last but not least, your have to tab thinking like you are tabbing for a person who never have listen the song before, if he can read you tab he'll play exactly the same as the original song. So detailing at the maximum is a good thing. This is what a you should improve in your tab.Kind regards

epic.squids: Thank you so much for taking the time to reply with this. I've changed the parts to how josh plays them and added in the extra fills. I made the tab before they started playing the song live so that's my excuse :P as for the chorus chords i added the extra notes and figured you can get the same sound with the notes you play, like half arpegiating and strumming. 

The pre-chours (I'm certain) is C, G, D then the main riff. Since the main riff is basically an A chord.

soaresvictor: You did some corrections and in fact I would gladly gave you a higher rating than before but I still feel that isn't 100% accurate so I will try to help you. There's some fills you're still missing like:
- At 0:00 you can hear a decrescent slide from 12 fret of sixth string;
- At 0:31 you can hear a slide from 3 fret of second string to the 5 fret.
For the Pre-chorus:
-You can see and hear from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF-hWQ3LWPQ Josh strumming the C, G, D and A chords, actually the main riff is an E minor chord. You are only alternating between two octaves from the same note (E);
- Josh also strums an Em minor chord pressing the first, second and third string at the twelfth fret with a sixtuplet feel before going to the Chorus.
For the Chorus:
- Again, you should display the chords so you tab can be more complete;
- The bends that I spoke early are played simultaneously with the chords. You play the Bm and bend the ninth fret fourth string a whole step, the you do the same with Bb chords bend the ninth fret...;
- In the last chorus at 3:38 there's a lick which you could describe like a double pick at the D note on B string with the E string open ringing and a quick slide to the E note on the B string some strums then double pick at B note on G string with the B string open.
I think that's all and don't forget to add the time for each section.
Stay awesome

I made this because there are no other tabs around for this great tune. 
It's all done by ear so it might not be 100%, feel free to let me know 
whats wrong and good etc. 

EDIT: Edited the main parts to fit with how Josh plays them, and added the different fills.

This part is a bugger to figure out since it's masked in reverb, delay, wah
and god knows what else. So I did what i could, it's pretty much a section you
can improv over. As pointed out in the comments is a pentatonic lick and I can't be
asked to tab it. Someone else can.
