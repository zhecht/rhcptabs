[Intro]

Am
Am Em G


[Verse 1]

Am
 That’s right you’re right
Em                             G
We will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
Am                    
 It’s time you’re fine
Em                       G
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
Am
 You told my friend
Em                           G
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Am
 Let’s go you show
Em                            G
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination


[Chorus]

F
Another lonely superstar
   Em
To get away inside your car
Dm
Take it much too far
F
Surrender to the brave inside
  Em
A lover that another tried
Dm
Take it, too my ride

F                 Em              Dm
You don’t have to keep it if it’s mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
F                Em         Dm
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)


[Verse 2]

Am
 Complete repeat
Em                              G
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Am
 Let’s steal this wheel
Em                             G
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Am 
 Slow down for sound
Em                            G
Turn it up and no we can’t be found
The body that we transcend
Am
 Asleep, you weep
Em                               G
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend


[Chorus]

F
Another lonely superstar
   Em
To get away inside your car
Dm
Take it much too far
F
Surrender to the brave inside
  Em
A lover that another tried
Dm
Take it, too my ride

F                 Em              Dm
You don’t have to keep it if it’s mine
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
F                Em         Dm
Another place maybe another time
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)


[Bridge]

Am C
Am Em G


[Verse 3]

Am
 That’s right you’re right
Em                             G
We will do our thing tonight alright
Drive the constellation
Am                    
 It’s time you’re fine
Em                       G
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination


[Chorus]

F
Another lonely superstar
   Em
To get away inside your car
Dm
Take it much too far
F
Surrender to the brave inside
  Em
A lover that another tried
Dm
Take it, too my ride

  F            Em              Dm
A May December might not be so smart
(Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car)
  F              Em             Dm
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
(Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried)


[Outro]

A#       C                    Dm
Don’t be late cause you’re my savior
A#      C              Dm      F
Make it great whatever stays
A#     C           Dm
Golden gate my rearranger
A#      C                Dm
Hold my name inside your rays
