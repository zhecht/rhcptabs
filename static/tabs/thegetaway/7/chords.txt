[Verse]

 [ch]Cm[/ch]                       
I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
 [ch]Cm[/ch]
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't take these things so personal
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore, anymore
 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't think it's irreversible
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore
 [ch]Cm[/ch]
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
 [ch]Cm[/ch]
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl


[Pre-Chorus]

 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't think that it's so terrible
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore, anymore
 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't think that it's unbearable
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore


[Chorus]

  [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]     [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
  [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]        [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Db[/ch]
You will find your flow when you go robot
  [ch]Fm[/ch]                          [ch]Ab[/ch]     
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
     [ch]Eb[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
Robots don't care where I've been
  [ch]Fm[/ch]                      [ch]Ab[/ch]    
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
 [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Db[/ch]
Robots are my next of kin

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Fm[/ch]

[Verse]

  [ch]Cm[/ch]
Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
  [ch]Fm[/ch]
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper


[Pre-Chorus]

 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't think that it's so personal
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore, anymore
 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't think it's irreversible
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore


[Chorus]

  [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]     [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
  [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]        [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Db[/ch]
You will find your flow when you go robot
  [ch]Fm[/ch]                          [ch]Ab[/ch]     
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
     [ch]Eb[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
Robots don't care where I've been
  [ch]Fm[/ch]                      [ch]Ab[/ch]    
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
 [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Db[/ch]
Robots are my next of kin

[ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch] [ch]Cm[/ch]

[Verse]

 [ch]Cm[/ch]
I'm kissing high and low
 
Our bodies like two dominoes
 [ch]Fm[/ch]
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
 [ch]Cm[/ch]
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey

 [ch]Fm[/ch]
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret

[Pre-Chorus]

 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't think that it's so terrible
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore, anymore
 [ch]Bb[/ch]
I don't think that it's unbearable
 [ch]Ab[/ch]
Anymore

[Chorus]

  [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]     [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Bb[/ch]
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
  [ch]Fm[/ch]      [ch]Ab[/ch]        [ch]Eb[/ch]          [ch]Db[/ch]
You will find your flow when you go robot
  [ch]Fm[/ch]                          [ch]Ab[/ch]     
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
     [ch]Eb[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
Robots don't care where I've been
  [ch]Fm[/ch]                      [ch]Ab[/ch]    
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
 [ch]Eb[/ch]            [ch]Db[/ch]
Robots are my next of kin

DeTimdeJong: not totally right

Metallidethca: Just does not sound right ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ship flag unicorn pizza globe horn ranarr

no_robot: Way I play it: Capo on 1, play the Cm as Bm*
Then the chords become (relative to the capo)[Verse] Bm* Em  [Pre-chorus] A G [Chorus] Em G D A; Em G D C

Sorry, should have clarified - Bm* here means x2023x (lowE -&gt; highE)
