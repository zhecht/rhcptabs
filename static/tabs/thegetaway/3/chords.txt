[Intro]
Cm
We got large and we got small
Cm
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
Cm
We turn red and we turn green
Cm
It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen

[Verse 1]
Gm
Lost my mind ’cause I’m on the plastic
Gm                    C  A#
Who knew it’s so damn drastic
Gm
Show me what it is you believe in
Gm                         C  A#
Slowly she sinks all your teeth in
Gm
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans
Gm                               C  A#
Do you want to get up early in the morning
Gm
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Gm                      C  A#
Hallelujah, I feel it warming

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm
Sitting here I count the moons
Gm             C  A#
The orders we obeyed
Gm
Every night ’fore we go to bed
Gm                       C  A#
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
A#
Send it off through Delaware just
Gm
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Dm                           Am
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
A#
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gm
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Dm                          Am
Serving up the stories of my mind

[Verse 2]
Gm
Mexico, you are my neighbor
Gm                    C  A#
Home of the let’s be braver
Gm
Give me all your sick and your tired
Gm             C  A#
Races that we admire
Gm
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago
Gm                        C  A# 
Trinidad’s got it bad for Tobago
Gm
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Gm                C  A#
Hallelujah, a desparado

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm
Sitting here I count the moons
Gm             C  A#
The orders we obeyed
Gm
Every night ’fore we go to bed
Gm                       C  A#
I watch while the others pray

[Chorus]
A#
Send it off through Delaware just
Gm
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Dm                           Am
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
A#
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gm
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Dm                          Am
Serving up the stories of my mind

[Bridge]
A#
Coming down from the deserts where you
Gm
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Dm                              Am
Tell me I’m the right one for the ride
A#
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gm
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Dm                          Am
Does your canyon really open wide

[Outro]
Cm
We got large and we got small
Cm
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
Cm
We turn red and we turn green
Cm
It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen
