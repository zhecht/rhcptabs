All the other versions sounded wrong so I decided to try it myself, and it sounds
really good. Use barre-chords for best result.

All you slingers and fiends
                 [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]
Hide behind your rocks
[ch]A[/ch]
Put down your gloves
               [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
I'm not here to box
[ch]A[/ch]
This is no showdown
                  [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]
So throw down your guns
[ch]A[/ch]
You see it doesn't matter
               [ch]C[/ch]     [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Where you come from
[ch]A[/ch]
You could be from Park Ave
              [ch]C[/ch]         [ch]A[/ch]
Or from a park bench
[ch]A[/ch]
You could be a politician
             [ch]C[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]    [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Or a bitchy princess
[ch]A[/ch]
But if you're lookin' for a fist
                     [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
And you're lookin' to unite
[ch]A[/ch]
Put your knuckleheads together
                  [ch]C[/ch]    [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Make a fist and fight
[ch]A[/ch]
Not to your death
                [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]
And not to your grave
[ch]A[/ch]
I'm talkin' bout that freedom
             [ch]C[/ch]      [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]G[/ch] [ch]D[/ch]
Fight like a brave

[ch]A[/ch]
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
[ch]G[/ch]                   [ch]D[/ch]
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission

Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme

Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
