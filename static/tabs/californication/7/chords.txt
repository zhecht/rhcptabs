[Intro]
Am Dm F Am

[Verse]
Am  Dm  F                    Am
Easily    let's get carried away
Am  Dm  F                     Am
Easily    let's get married today
Am                 Dm                   F                 Am
Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat,  Everything must go
  Am                                Dm
A lickin' stick is thicker when you break it to show           
F                 Am 
  Everything must go 

[Chorus]
    C                       G            Fmaj7
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
       C                      G                   Fmaj7
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for  
Am                  G                Fmaj7
Calling calling for something in the air
Am                 G                Fmaj7
Calling calling, I know you must be there

[Verse]
Am  Dm  F                     Am
Easily  let's get caught in a wave 
Am  Dm  F                        Am
Easily  we won't get caught in a cage 
Am                       Dm               F                 Am
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul,  Everything must go
Am                          Dm                      F                 Am 
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own,  everything must go 

[Chorus]
C                       G  Fmaj7
I can't tell you who to idolize 
    C                               G           Fmaj7
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise 
Am                   G                Fmaj7
Calling calling, for something in the air 
Am                 G                Fmaj7
Calling calling, I know you must be there 
    C                       G            Fmaj7
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
       C                      G                   Fmaj7
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for 
Am                                      G            Fmaj7
Throw me to the wolves because, there's order in the pack 
Am                             G               Fmaj7
Throw me to the sky, because I know I'm coming back

Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul,  Everything must go
Am                          Dm                      F                 Am 
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own,  everything must go

       C                      G                   Fmaj7
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for  
Am                  G                Fmaj7
Calling calling for something in the air
Am                 G                Fmaj7
Calling calling, I know you must be there

[Chorus]
C                              G               Fmaj7
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy 
    C                          G           Fmaj7
The creature that I am is only going to destroy 
Am                                      G            Fmaj7
Throw me to the wolves because, there's order in the pack 
Am                             G               Fmaj7
Throw me to the sky, because I know I'm coming back
