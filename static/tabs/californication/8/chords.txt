BrixDK: Perfect tab!! thank you very much :)

elkanser: Great tab, great songs, thans!

rjjena: I had the original Tab book. It says:

Bm7  F#m7   Amaj7
Little     lune
Bm7 Amaj7
All day
Bm7 F#m7   Amaj7
Little     lune

It also sounds better to me.

Alright, for anyone who wants to do an acoustic cover here it is. i use 7th chords to 
the mellow mood of the song.


[Verse 1]

Dmaj7  Amaj7
Porcelain
Dmaj7            F#m7
Are you wasting away in your skin
Dmaj7               Amaj7
Are you missing the love of your kin
Dmaj7                     F#m7
Drifting and floating and fading away


[Verse 2]

Dmaj7  Amaj7
Porcelain
Dmaj7               F#m7
Do you smell like a girl when you smile
Dmaj7               Amaj7
Can you bear not to share with your child
Dmaj7                     F#m7
Drifting and floating and fading away


[Chorus]

Bm7  C#m7   Amaj7

All day
Bm7 C#m7   Amaj7
Little     lune

[Verse 3]

Dmaj7  Amaj7
Porcelain
Dmaj7            F#m7
Do you carry the moon in your womb
Dmaj7                    Amaj7
Someone said that youâ€™re fading too soon
Dmaj7                     F#m7
Drifting and floating and fading away


[Verse 4]

Dmaj7  Amaj7
Porcelain
Dmaj7            F#m7
Are you wasting away in your skin
Dmaj7               Amaj7
Are you missing the love of your kin
Dmaj7                   F#m7
Nodding and melting and fading away


[Chorus]

Bm7  C#m7   Amaj7

All day
Bm7 C#m7   Amaj7
Little     lune

Bm7  C#m7   Amaj7
Little     lune
Bm7 Amaj7
All day
