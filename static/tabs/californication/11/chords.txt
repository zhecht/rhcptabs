show.off: I think, chords should be placed like this, or somehow that looks like this
(Dm)Close (C)to my (Bb)skin
I'm falling (Dm)in               
Some(C)one who's (Bb)been

show.off: damn, I can't write it right in the comment because of format system, sorry

florianbingold: I have the feeling the chords should come twice as often.
for example: 
close to my skin i'm falling 1x Dm C Bb Bb
In someone who's been 1x Dm C Bb Bb 

Otherwise, the tab sounds great and the lyrics are correct, so thanks for the original tabbing

 I'm falling in
     C           Bb     Bb
 Someone who's been
Dm       C       Bb
 Sitting by the phone
     Bb     Dm
 I'm left alone
     C       Bb     Bb
 In another zone
Dm    C       Bb   Bb      Dm
 John says to live above hell
    C         Bb     Bb
 My will is well
Dm  C      Bb
 No one is waiting 
     Bb     Dm
 For me to fail

[VERSE]

Dm           C           Bb            Bb
 It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
   Dm                C              Bb                Bb
 I want to taste the taste of being face to face with common grace
Dm      C             Bb      Bb
 To meditate on the warmest dream
Dm          C            Bb            Bb
 And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme


[CHORUS]

Dm
 You solar eyes are like
Am
 Nothing I have ever seen
Dm
 Somebody close
Am
 That can see right through
Dm
 I'd take a fall and you know
Am
 That I'd do anything
C            Am
 I will for you.

 'Cause there is one
       C          Bb     Bb
 Knows where I'm from
Dm C         Bb
 I care for you
   Bb      Dm
 I really do
   C       Bb     Bb
 I really do
Dm    C      Bb
 Come closer now
    Bb       Dm
 So you can lie
       C       Bb     Bb
 Right by my side
Dm    C            Bb
 Sit alone in the sun
           Bb         Dm
 I wrote a letter to you

 Getting over my self, yeah
