mR. haniKa: Very accurate! However, I am pretty sure, that in chord progression Am G/B C D the last D-chord should actually be a G (Am G/B C _G_).

Tilt_Mode: sounds good to me :) i love chords at ug
can u imagine how long it would take people to figure out every song they wanna play. a toast to the internet !

TheGuitarrer: Awesome Chords!
I also think that the chord progression is Am G/B C G 
(G is played xx(5)787)
I guess the part with the diminished chords starts with F#°
and the higher ones are the same one on different frets starting
with D#°, then C°, A°, F#°, D#°
