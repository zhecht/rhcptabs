Intro:  G   Gm   Eb   Bbm

F     C       Dm
  Magpies on fire
F          C                Dm
  Making love like little wolves
  Out on the porch
  Can lead to medicine
F    C          Dm
  Oh well I m game,
      G           Bb (hold)
  For anything at all

F       C       Dm
  Scarecrows a liar
F          C
  Spins a yarn and no one
 Dm
  Ever checked it out
  To see if it was real
F       C       Dm
  Sold you the moon and
   G                Bb
  Now it s time to fall

Gm
  All along
  It s like a bird
  Who s trapped alone
              Eb    Bbm
  Inside your cage, love

F       Eb         Bb
  What more do you want?

  All in all
                Gm
  It s just the call
                Eb
  Of something wild
               Bb (hold)
  Beyond your room

G
  There s a changing
  Of the major chord
       Gm                Eb   Bbm
  Your minor threat will do, love

F     C      Dm
  My gun misfired
F         C   
  Shot myself instead
     Dm
  I guess I always knew
  I d be the one to lose
F        C           Dm
  That screen door slams
   G             Bb (hold)
  Time to make a move

F       Eb         Bb
  What more do you want?

  It s like a bird
                 Eb
  Who s trapped alone
               Am    Dm
  Inside your cage, love

    Gm
  A bird who s born
      Eb               Am    Dm
  To live at half your age, girl
     Gm
  A bird who s
         Eb         Bb (hold)
  Never really had a say


F       Eb         Bb

  Least of all
               Gm
  She s like a bird
                 Eb
  Who s now been freed
               Bb
  From someones cage
