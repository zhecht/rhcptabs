C            Bb          Am           G            
Brave from afar when I hold you for country

C           Bb           Am         E
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing

Bm           Am             Em
Do you feel safe when they tell you 

     Em        E
they sell you

Bm            Am           Em
Before your children the shelter

       Em      E
they buildin'

E
Prime time the perfect crime

E
Bow my head the AX we grind

E
Ruse cruise P's and Q's

E
I got beat up by the evening news

E
Deep hits the media blitz

E
Lost my mind to keep my wits

E
Maintain the same old same

E
Goodbye shiz and so long game


C            Bb          Am           G

Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing

Do you feel safe when they tell you 

     Em        E
they sell you

Bm            Am           Em
Before your children the shelter

       Em      E

E
Plain Jane the big campaign

E
The last detail has been restrained

E
Fraud fraud the lightning rod

E
When you see to sign time to applaud


C           Bb         Am             G            
Brave from afar when I hold you for country

Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing

Bm           Am             Em
Do you feel safe when they tell you 

     Em        E
they sell you

Bm            Am           Em
Before your children the shelter
