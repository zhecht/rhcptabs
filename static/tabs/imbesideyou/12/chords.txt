Dimitris_RHCP: Pretty accurate, but I think that you forgot something on verse and the chorus doesn't sound correct. Keep up :)

Red Hot Day: I've already edited tab, dunno why, but i can't save it.

UPD.

[Intro]

Am F Am F

[Verse]

Am
Death
                   F
Let me catch my breath
                   Dm
Let me see what's left
Let me see what's true
E
Do I really want to
              Am
Run from my depths
              F
Will I have regrets
              Dm
Will I ever find you
Will I ever find words
E                          F   E 
That give me motive to express
Am
Bread
            F
Will I go unfed
                               Dm
Will I be the one who rushed on in
          E             Am
To where angel fear to tread
               F
Was it me who bled
                 Dm
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
E
When you're leaning on love
        F      E
Those grateful dead

[Chorus]
   A    G   F     ( G )
Someone like you
Am                G         C    ( G )
To research the meaning of love
A        G F   ( G )
Someone, I do
Am                G              C   ( G )
To be there when push comes to shove
F                      ( G )
I know that you know
   C         G
The ending numbers

[Verse]
Am
Chess
                F
Let me play my rest
            Dm
When I do regress
Let it all unwind
E               Am
To the board unless
               F
Less I second guess
               Dm
Look into the sky
Where we all comply
E
With something higher than the
               F      E
Rest my love, sail through

[Chorus]
   A    G   F     ( G )
Someone like you
Am                G         C    ( G )
To research the meaning of love
A        G F   ( G )
Someone, I do
Am                G              C   ( G )
To be there when push comes to shove
F                      ( G )
I know that you know
   C         G
The ending numbers

[Bridge]
Bb  C    Am
Sky all around
Bb   C      Am
Fell to the ground
Bb5  C5   G5
Now I'm a child
Bb   C      Am
Stayed for a while

[Verse]
Am
Flesh
               F
Is it meaningless
              Dm
But we all protest
To the last request
E                
Is there anything you
            Am
could now suggest
             F
Did I do my best
                 Dm
Did I leave it better
Even though we look to be
E
Just mildly obsessed with you
  F    E
Sail through

[Chorus]

   A    G   F     (G)
Someone like you
Am                G         C    ( G )
To research the meaning of love
A        G F   ( G )
Someone, I do
Am                G              C   ( G )
To be there when push comes to shove
 F                      ( G )
I know that you know
   C         G
The ending numbers
A        G    F
Someone like you
    E
To be there
