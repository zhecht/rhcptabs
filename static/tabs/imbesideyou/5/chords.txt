Chords and lyrics are not 100% but I hope this helps





F         Dm             C7  F    A#m
   If I stole it all, or hesitate

F                   Dm             C7  Fm
   The world would always never seems to wait

A#m      C#               G#    A#m
   A comedy that could be so divine

F#            C#
   Never is a long time

F#          D#m               C#7      F#   Bm
   A shadow born to steal the light of day

F#          D#m               C#7      F#m
   You woke me up and said come on let's play

Bm           D               G   F#m
   But now I know this never had between



    Bm        D       G
You are, you are the star within

     Bm        D          G
From far, from far, from far away

    Bm         D        G
The law that caused it all to stay

  A       G       A       G        A      G     [DROP!]
By you, by you, by you, by you, for you, I do



(Chords remain the same until...)
A
  A never that will always 


     Bm        D       G
You are, you are the star within

     Bm        D          G
From far, from far, from far away

    Bm         D        G
The law that caused it all to stay

  A       G       A       G
by you, by you, By you, by you
  A             G                   A               G 
A baby cla&#7767;ping on your dress, will always have a place I guess

(A and G are repeated until it changes to Bm, D, G)

(Song also ends with    Bm   D   G)
