Intro: Dm


Dm
Drivin' up the coast
To find a version of the truth
Dm
Left the backdoor swinging
Like a dirty little sleuth
     C                Bb
The truth is I have never
           Am
Felt half this alive
C
Now it's time to dance
                       Dm
Upon the grave called 45

Dm
Jacked up on some Kerouac
And surely bullet proof
Dm
The girl who taught me what to do
Was missing her front tooth
C           Bb
Gentle as a storm
            Am 
Inside your mental health
  C
I wanna find the answer
                         Dm
But I just can't find myself


  Dm
I say so long
       C
To the way I played
    C
The way I played
          G
Inside of yesterday
Dm        C 
Hey let's run around
    C
The great escape
            G         Dm
From out of my hometown


Dm
Later I would look for love
Inside a woman's dorm
Dm
A couch to keep me humble
And her breath to keep me warm
C               Bb
Ophelia was the girl
           Am
That I was feeling for
C
Come to realize
                         Dm
It was me who was the whore

Dm
A captain lost himself
Inside a 40 year old skull
Dm
The drink of choice was knowledge
And we always wanted more
C
Drunken sailors
Bb               Am
Seeking their Geronimo
   C
Instead they found the things
                                Dm
That they really didn't wanna know


  Dm
I say so long
       C
To the way I played
    C
The way I played
          G
Inside of yesterday
Dm        C 
Hey let's run around
    C
The great escape
            G
From out of my hometown

Dm
Country roads
            C
Would never let me stay
C
The way I played
          G        A*
Inside of yesterday


- Bridge-thingy (No acoustic guitar) -


Dm
A devil's growl and cat's meow
Were blended into one
Dm
Termites called suburbanites
Were eating all the fun
  C             Bb
A juggernaut of comedy
    Am
And blasphemy
  C
I wanna stop the madness
                       Dm
But I think it has to be


  Dm
I say so long
       C
To the way I played
    C
The way I played
          G
Inside of yesterday
Dm        C 
Hey let's run around
    C
The great escape
            G
From out of my hometown

Dm
Country roads
            C
Would never let me stay
C
The way I played
          G
Inside of yesterday
Dm        C 
Hey let's run around
    C
The great escape
            G         Dm
From out of my hometown


Outro is repeating Dm again.
