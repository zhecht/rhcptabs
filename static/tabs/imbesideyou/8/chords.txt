Intro: [ch]Dm[/ch]


[ch]Dm[/ch]
Drivin' up the coast
To find a version of the truth
[ch]Dm[/ch]
Left the backdoor swinging
Like a dirty little sleuth
     [ch]C[/ch]                [ch]Bb[/ch]
The truth is I have never
           [ch]Am[/ch]
Felt half this alive
[ch]C[/ch]
Now it's time to dance
                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
Upon the grave called 45

[ch]Dm[/ch]
Jacked up on some Kerouac
And surely bullet proof
[ch]Dm[/ch]
The girl who taught me what to do
Was missing her front tooth
[ch]C[/ch]           [ch]Bb[/ch]
Gentle as a storm
            [ch]Am[/ch] 
Inside your mental health
  [ch]C[/ch]
I wanna find the answer
                         [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I just can't find myself


  [ch]Dm[/ch]
I say so long
       [ch]C[/ch]
To the way I played
    [ch]C[/ch]
The way I played
          [ch]G[/ch]
Inside of yesterday
[ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch] 
Hey let's run around
    [ch]C[/ch]
The great escape
            [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
From out of my hometown


[ch]Dm[/ch]
Later I would look for love
Inside a woman's dorm
[ch]Dm[/ch]
A couch to keep me humble
And her breath to keep me warm
[ch]C[/ch]               [ch]Bb[/ch]
Ophelia was the girl
           [ch]Am[/ch]
That I was feeling for
[ch]C[/ch]
Come to realize
                         [ch]Dm[/ch]
It was me who was the whore

[ch]Dm[/ch]
A captain lost himself
Inside a 40 year old skull
[ch]Dm[/ch]
The drink of choice was knowledge
And we always wanted more
[ch]C[/ch]
Drunken sailors
[ch]Bb[/ch]               [ch]Am[/ch]
Seeking their Geronimo
   [ch]C[/ch]
Instead they found the things
                                [ch]Dm[/ch]
That they really didn't wanna know


  [ch]Dm[/ch]
I say so long
       [ch]C[/ch]
To the way I played
    [ch]C[/ch]
The way I played
          [ch]G[/ch]
Inside of yesterday
[ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch] 
Hey let's run around
    [ch]C[/ch]
The great escape
            [ch]G[/ch]
From out of my hometown

[ch]Dm[/ch]
Country roads
            [ch]C[/ch]
Would never let me stay
[ch]C[/ch]
The way I played
          [ch]G[/ch]        [ch]A[/ch]*
Inside of yesterday


- Bridge-thingy (No acoustic guitar) -


[ch]Dm[/ch]
A devil's growl and cat's meow
Were blended into one
[ch]Dm[/ch]
Termites called suburbanites
Were eating all the fun
  [ch]C[/ch]             [ch]Bb[/ch]
A juggernaut of comedy
    [ch]Am[/ch]
And blasphemy
  [ch]C[/ch]
I wanna stop the madness
                       [ch]Dm[/ch]
But I think it has to be


  [ch]Dm[/ch]
I say so long
       [ch]C[/ch]
To the way I played
    [ch]C[/ch]
The way I played
          [ch]G[/ch]
Inside of yesterday
[ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch] 
Hey let's run around
    [ch]C[/ch]
The great escape
            [ch]G[/ch]
From out of my hometown

[ch]Dm[/ch]
Country roads
            [ch]C[/ch]
Would never let me stay
[ch]C[/ch]
The way I played
          [ch]G[/ch]
Inside of yesterday
[ch]Dm[/ch]        [ch]C[/ch] 
Hey let's run around
    [ch]C[/ch]
The great escape
            [ch]G[/ch]         [ch]Dm[/ch]
From out of my hometown


Outro is repeating Dm again.
