neerass: The lyrics in the last line should be "Tell 'em Flea, go ahead" not Frank lol Anthony's talking to Flea (the bassist)

Key: Gm

Intro: Gm F Bb F Gm F


Bb                               
Sat on a cliff wondering what did I miss
                 F 
I watched the waves come in,
Gm                                   F
Roll in, roll out, without a single doubt
Bb
Lone on the bluff, is there ever enough
          F           Gm
I stare into the air, somewhere out there,
       F           Bb
The family affair, bring home the night


Eb
F    Cm  Gm                         Eb
There I know that you turn off the light
F       Cm   Gm            D7                     Gm
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life


Gm                    F Bb
   She gave me the love


                                                            F
Coming up short and I’m sad to report, with us invite tonight
Gm                                    F
Your kiss, my kiss, another day to waste
Bb                                                         F
Lovers don’t miss, when they can’t even face a plot that has a twist
Gm                                       F
To share, my &#7767;rayer, I need my baby bear,
Bb
Come home tonight
Eb
Whoa


F    Cm  Gm                         Eb
There I know that you turn off the light
F       Cm  Gm           D7                     Gm
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life

Eb
F   Cm  Gm                         Eb
There I know that you turn off the light
F       Cm  Gm           D7                     Gm
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life

Eb
Whoa
 F    Cm  Gm                         Eb
There I know that you turn off the light
F      Cm  Gm           D7                     Gm
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life
Eb F     Cm  Gm                         Eb
 There I know that I waited so long
F     Cm  Gm           D7                     Gm
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life


Gm                                 F 
Oh she gave me the love of my life
Gm                       F 
Tell ‘em Frank, go ahead
