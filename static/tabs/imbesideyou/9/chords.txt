RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS
I'M WITH YOU SESSIONS (2012/2013)
PINK AS FLOYD




I thought the chords from the other tab were quite hard for beginners, so I made 
this version WITH CAPO 1 wich is slighly easier for beginning guitarists =)

So, CAPO 1.



The Chords:

  G   A  F#m  Bm  Bb  B   E  Bm7  D   G#  G* Eb  Dm

|-3-|-0-|-2-|-2-|-1-|-2-|-0-|-2-|-2-|-4-|-3-|-6-|-5-|
|-0-|-2-|-2-|-3-|-3-|-4-|-0-|-3-|-3-|-4-|-3-|-8-|-6-|
|-0-|-2-|-2-|-4-|-3-|-4-|-1-|-2-|-2-|-5-|-4-|-8-|-7-|
|-0-|-2-|-4-|-4-|-3-|-4-|-2-|-4-|-0-|-6-|-5-|-8-|-7-|
|-2-|-0-|-4-|-2-|-1-|-2-|-2-|-2-|---|-6-|-5-|-6-|-5-|
|-3-|---|-2-|---|---|---|-0-|---|---|-4-|-3-|---|---|
                              !

The G* is simply the barre chord.







Intro: G A F#m Bm x2

Verse:
G           A
Say what you need to say
        F#m             Bm
Make it clear, make it great
           G
Cause its not too late
            A
And theres no mistake
         F#m
When you shine
                Bm      Bb
Shake it for me anyway---
       G
Now we crash the gate
     A
To investigate

Someone to love

Make it for me anyway
        G
When we fill the void
        A
That is Pink As Floyd
       F#m
To destroy
                Bm          Bb
Records that we file away---
         G
And Ill clean the slate
     A
As I calculate

Your fate

Verse:
        G           A
And you shine as you redefine
     F#m                 Bm
Your time, just another time of day
       G
Do you feel the spark
         A
When you play the part
     F#m
Superstar
               Bm      Bb
Fake it for me anyway---
        G
Time to tell them all
        A
Without hem or haw
   F#m
No applause
                 Bm
Tell them how to generate
       G
How to raise the bar
       A
How to keep it hard
      F#m                    Bm      Bb
To be alive, make it for me anyway---
       G
If you care at all
         A
You will bare it all
         F#m                     Bm
You will grind, shake it for me anyway
        G
Born to play the part
      A
Dying for your art
         F#m
'cause its time
               Bm      Bb
Take it for me anyway---
         G
You will clear the air
       A
With a single stare
     B
Your fate
