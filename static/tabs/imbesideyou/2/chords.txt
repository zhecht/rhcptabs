G
Smile
          D
When I'm shy in ways
       Am
But I love
C               G
Everything of first impressions
Csus
Sweet succession

Em7
Been around for quite a while
I see you kept in versatile
Motivated to combine
Even when it's bad it's fine
Eb
Did she say something
               G
That made you cry
          D
Have you lost it all
         Am
The big fall
Csus
Oh so slowly
               D
Comes back holy

Em               D
Bishop takes a knight
            Am             G
But I will put up quite a fight
C             B7     Em
Here is your ham on rye
Em                 D
Elementary the chemistry
      Am            G
Means everything to me
C          B7          Em
Long progression's why

Em7
Set it off to collect knowledge
Quit a job
And go to college
All about the aftershock
Swedish latin super funk

Eb
Moses of Manhattan
          G
Made it great
         D
Pain we celebrate
       Am
And I love
       Csus                      D
The long progression, indiscretion

Long progression's why

Em                D
In between the reasons
           Am        G
Are the psychedelic seasons
C          B7       Em
Simple as your stride
Em              D
Information intimated
Am           G
Elegant and integrated
C            B7       Em
Sweet your corporate pride
