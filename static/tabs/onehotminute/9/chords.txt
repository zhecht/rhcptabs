Red Hot Day: where are the a#5 and b5?

Joemhayward000: I think A and Bb sounds better personally, and it's easier.

[Verse]
D              F#m
My mouth fell open
G                 A
Hoping that the truth
               D
Would not be true
F#m         Bm   A
Refuse the news

[Verse]
D              F#m
I'm feeling sick now
G                A
What the fuck am I
            D
Supposed to do
      F#m      Bm   A
Just lose and lose

[Verse]
D              F#m
First time I saw you
G               
You were sitting
A               D      
Backstage in a dress
   F#m    Bm    A
A perfect mess

[Verse]
D              F#m
You never knew this
G             A             D
But I wanted badly for you to
   F#m     Bm
Requite my love

[Chorus]
C             Em
Left on the floor
C             Em
Leaving your body
C                   Em
When highs are the lows
                  F#m
And lows are the way
Em          F#m
So hard to stay
A              Bb
Guess now you know
A          Bb   A     D
I love you so

[Verse]
D              F#m
I liked your whiskers
G
And I liked the
A                D
Dimple in your chin
     F#m       Bm   A
Your pale blue eyes

[Verse]
D           F#m
You painted pictures
G
Cause the one
       A
That hurts
            D
Can give so much
F#m          Bm
You gave me such

[Chorus]
C             Em
Left on the floor
C             Em
Leaving your body
C                   Em
When highs are the lows
                  F#m
And lows are the way
Em          F#m
So hard to stay
A              Bb
Guess now you know
A          Bb   A     D
I love you so
