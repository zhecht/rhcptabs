E5
I am just a lousy bum searching for the unknown crumb,
the crumb, the crumb.

E5
Something or someone to come, come along illuminate my lust,
combust.

Confucius might have been confused and Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse.

E5
Back and forth my body's jerking
will to thrill will not stop working,
work and work
i'll take you on a honeymoon,
jumping on a bed in a hotel room
the room, the groom
