LYRICS

I tumble into space, try to stop the fall
My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space

Could have floated

I stumble 'round my home
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love from no one

Could have floated

My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've been down

My friends are aliens and I've been down

Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back to life
I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces
Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down
I am the big rock star yeah I've been down
I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own
My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down
My friends are aliens and I've been down
I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil
sneaks in and deals and I've been
