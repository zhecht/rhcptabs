Gm7                  C7
Sitting in my kitchen, hey girl
    Gm7                      C7
I'm turning into dust again
   Gm7              C7
My melancholy baby
                  Gm7
The star of mazzy must
                 C7
Push her voice inside of me
    Gm7               C7
I'm overcoming gravity
    Gm7               C7
I'm overcoming gravity
     Gm7                  C7
It's easy when you're sad to be
     Gm7                 C7
It's easy when you're sad, sad like me

A#5/D#   
Just one note
       A#/F  F6   
Could make me float
        A#/F           Gm  
Could make me float away
A#5/D#   
One note from
       A#/F  F6   
The song she wrote
      A#/F                Gm  
Could fuck me where I lay
A#5/D#   
Just one note
       A#/F  F6   
Could make me choke
    A#/F   
One note that's
          Gm  
Not a lie
A#5/D#   
Just one note
          F6    
Could cut my throat
         Gm
One note could make me die

It's my aeroplane
Gm11
Songbird sweet and sour Jane and
C7
Music is my aeroplane
Gm11        C7
It's my aeroplane that's spiked with
Gm7 C7
Pain
Gm7 C7
Pain
Gm7 C7
Pain
Gm7 C7
Pain
