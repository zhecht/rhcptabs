[Verse 1]
B7                 E7
  Persistent mystic  faults my vision
B7                          E7
  Its like always this point  of collision
B7                 E7
  Its raining in my  cranium
    F#7        G7     D7
My head feels like a stadium

[Verse 2]
B7                   E7
  Three pound of love  about to burst
B7                     E7
  Inside my three pound  Universe
B7                 E7
  Its raining in my ranium
    F#7        G7     D7
My head feels like a stadium

[Chorus]
F#                            E      G#m    F#
  These are the melancholy mechanics  of my mind
F#                            E      G#m    F#
  These are the melancholy mechanics  of my mind

[Verse 3]
B7                        E7
  Symbols I've been given to express my goal
B7                             E7
  Always come up short You know they just don't get that low
B7                 E7
  Its raining in my ranium
    F#7        G7     D7
My head feels like a stadium

                A                                        E
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
                                 E7
Bio organic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devastation
                  B7                                           E7
Cleaner than light  meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
                             F#                         G
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers
     D
Of suffering succotash
               Bm
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration,
B                                                       E
 Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation
   B           E
I wait I wait
F#7         G7  D7
    For the waaaaaave to break.
