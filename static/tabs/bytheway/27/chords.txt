UtBDan: the chords are all one flat.

Lord Mike: Cheers for that. It's a good little song to play to.

Thanks!

Subbaman: I think it's just a normal G rather than G7, but otherwise good job.

Teenager In Love – Red Hot Chili Peppers


Intro:

C          Am         F        G7
Uuuuuh     Uuuuuh Wah Uuuuh    Uuuuuh

C	     Am	    F        G7
Uuuuuh     Uuuuuh Wah Uuuuh    Uuuuuh

Verse 1:
C	         Am 	        F	       G7	
  Each time we have a quarrel    it almost breaks my heart
C	      Am          F  		    G7
 `Cause I’m so afraid     that we will have depart
C	         Am      F          G7  C(short, then A little break)
  Each night I ask the stars up above    WHY MUST I BE A TEENAGER IN LOVE?

	After „...IN LOVE?“ I play this:
	E----------------|
	B----------------|
	G----------------| Actually Flea play it on bass, 
	D----------------| but it sounds good, too!
	A-----1-3-4------|
	E-4-4------------|

Verse 2:
C           Am             F           G7
  One day I feel so happy   next day I feel so sad
C           Am             F         G7
  I guess I have to learn   the good with the bad
C              Am      F          G7  C(short, then A little break)
  Each night I ask the stars up above    WHY MUST I BE A TEENAGER IN LOVE?

Bridge:
F           G7    F                G7
  I cried a tear,   for nobody but you
F           G7            F                    G7
  I’ll be a lonely one if you should say we’re through

Verse 3:
C                     Am          F                  G7
  Well if you want to make me cry   that won’t be so hard to do
C                   Am           F                  G7
  And if you should say goodbye   I’ll still go on loving you
C	           Am       F         G7    C(short, then A little break)
  Each night I ask the stars up above    WHY MUST I BE A TEENAGER IN LOVE?
