samlynch: aaaaaaaaaaaagh

wunder79: i would leave out the G's in the chorus

skatevans99: ^agreed, it sounds better if the G is replaced with Bm in my oppinion. also, the chords arent matched up well with how they should flow with the lyrics.

[Intro]
Bm G A F#
Bm G A F# 

[Verse 1]
Bm                   G            A        
I've got myself In a masochistic hold
F#                 Bm
Why don't you let go 
                      G            A
Shake it off just to redirect my flow
F#
Come on let's go 
Bm                       G
Sit up straight I'm on a double date
           A 
I've got to find my way 
          F#
Into the light, heavy, middle weight 
Bm                  G
We don't stop rock around the clock 
     A                         F#
Motor mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]
G                                         F#
Come again and tell me what you're going thru
G                                F#      
Like a girl who only knew her child was due 

[Chorus]
Bm          D             A              Em 
Memories of everything Of lemon trees on mercury
Bm              D             A              F#
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas
Bm          D             A                Em 
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Bm          D               A        F#           
Memories of everything that blew through

[Verse 2]
Bm                    G                A
Looking up into a reverse vertigo
F#              Bm
What an undertow
Bm                 G             A   F#      
Give it up another stubborn scorpio, come on, let's go 
Bm                       G
Sit up straight I'm on a double date
           A 
I've got to find my way 
          F#
Into the light, heavy, middle weight 
Bm                  G
We don't stop rock around the clock 
     A                         F#
Motor mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]
G                                  F#
Come again and tell me what you're going thru
G                             F#      
Like a girl who only knew her child was due
G                             F#
To the moon she gave another good review
G
Turn around and look at me
    F#
It's really really you

[Chorus]
Bm          D             A              Em 
Memories of everything Of lemon trees on mercury
Bm              D             A              F#
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas
Bm          D             A                Em 
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Bm          D               A        F#           
Memories of everything that blew through

[Interlude]
Bm G A F# 
Bm G A F# 

[Verse 3]
Bm                      G
Sit up straight I'm on a double date
                   A 
I've got to find my way 
             F#
Into the light, heavy, middle weight 
Bm                            G
We don't stop rock around the clock 
     A                         F#
Motor mouthing off in front of every other road block
