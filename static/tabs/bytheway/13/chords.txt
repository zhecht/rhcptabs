[ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]G[/ch] [ch]A[/ch] [ch]F#[/ch] 

[Verse 1]
[ch]Bm[/ch]                   [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]        
I've got myself In a masochistic hold
[ch]F#[/ch]                 [ch]Bm[/ch]
Why don't you let go 
                      [ch]G[/ch]            [ch]A[/ch]
Shake it off just to redirect my flow
[ch]F#[/ch]
Come on let's go 
[ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Sit up straight I'm on a double date
           [ch]A[/ch] 
I've got to find my way 
          [ch]F#[/ch]
Into the light, heavy, middle weight 
[ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
We don't stop rock around the clock 
     [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]
Motor mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]
[ch]G[/ch]                                         [ch]F#[/ch]
Come again and tell me what you're going thru
[ch]G[/ch]                                [ch]F#[/ch]      
Like a girl who only knew her child was due 

[Chorus]
[ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch] 
Memories of everything Of lemon trees on mercury
[ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]F#[/ch]
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas
[ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]                [ch]Em[/ch] 
You always took me with a smile when I was down
[ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]A[/ch]        [ch]F#[/ch]           
Memories of everything that blew through

[Verse 2]
[ch]Bm[/ch]                    [ch]G[/ch]                [ch]A[/ch]
Looking up into a reverse vertigo
[ch]F#[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]
What an undertow
[ch]Bm[/ch]                 [ch]G[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]   [ch]F#[/ch]      
Give it up another stubborn scorpio, come on, let's go 
[ch]Bm[/ch]                       [ch]G[/ch]
Sit up straight I'm on a double date
           [ch]A[/ch] 
I've got to find my way 
          [ch]F#[/ch]
Into the light, heavy, middle weight 
[ch]Bm[/ch]                  [ch]G[/ch]
We don't stop rock around the clock 
     [ch]A[/ch]                         [ch]F#[/ch]
Motor mouthing off in front of every other road block

[Pre-Chorus]
[ch]G[/ch]                                  [ch]F#[/ch]
Come again and tell me what you're going thru
[ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]F#[/ch]      
Like a girl who only knew her child was due
[ch]G[/ch]                             [ch]F#[/ch]
To the moon she gave another good review
[ch]G[/ch]
Turn around and look at me
    [ch]F#[/ch]
It's really really you

[Chorus]
[ch]Bm[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]             [ch]A[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]

samlynch: aaaaaaaaaaaagh

wunder79: i would leave out the G's in the chorus

skatevans99: ^agreed, it sounds better if the G is replaced with Bm in my oppinion. also, the chords arent matched up well with how they should flow with the lyrics.
