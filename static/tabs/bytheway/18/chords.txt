minafrusciante: i think the ill pick you up yes its a date is G D Em...not A D Bm

[Verse]
D              A     Bm
Here she comes in a suit and tie
D              A     Bm
Shepard’s bush and a leopard’s pie
A   G            D  Bm
She marching to the funky beat of
G                D  Em
James Brown and his dancing feet
D         A      Bm
Gonna set your fish on fire
D           A    Bm
Pistol whipping of desire
A  G             D   Bm
So please do not resist your fate
A                D   Bm
I’ll pick you up yes it’s a date

[Pre-Chorus]
C              D                  Em
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention
C                  D
Sitting there in a silent movie
Em
Beside the only girl who really ever moved me
C              D
Happy days but sad I’m facin
Em
Heaven knows that I’m on the case
C              D                  B
How could I forget to mention the bicycle

[Chorus]
G        D        C
Somebody told the world
G          D       C
The beauty of your verse
G         D        C
My girl I heard it first
G          D       C
The beauty of your verse
