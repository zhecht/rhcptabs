This is the isolated guitar track, and if you skip ahead to the 1 minute mark, it's clear the chorus progression (despite the power chords in the beginning) are actually F C Dm | F C Am Bb.  It also makes more sense for Frusciante's vocal harmonies, as he hits an F and D on what you've labeled as an Am chord.
