Am                          C
Standing in line to see the show tonight,
             F
And there's a light on, heavy glow.
Am           C                F
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for.
Am                      C
Dani the girl is singing songs to me,
            F
Beneath the marquee... of her soul.
Am           C               F
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for.

This is the isolated guitar track, and if you skip ahead to the 1 minute mark, it's clear the chorus progression (despite the power chords in the beginning) are actually F C Dm | F C Am Bb.  It also makes more sense for Frusciante's vocal harmonies, as he hits an F and D on what you've labeled as an Am chord.

[Intro]
F C Am

[Chorus]
F                           C
Standing in line to see the show tonight

And there's a light on, heavy glow
F            C                Am
By the way I tried to say I'd be there, waiting for
F                        C
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
            Am
Beneath the marquee, overload
