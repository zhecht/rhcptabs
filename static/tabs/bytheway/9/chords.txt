[Intro]
F#m       Dmaj7 D Dmaj7 D
F#m       Dmaj7 D Dmaj7 D

[Verse 1]
      F#m       Dmaj7 D Dmaj7 D
Things will never be the same
      F#m       Dmaj7 D Dmaj7 D
Still I'm awfully glad I came
     Bm7          Dmaj7 D Dmaj7 D Dmaj7
Resonating in the shape of things to come
     Bm7          Dmaj7 D Dmaj7 D Dmaj7
Never waiting when I know there's only one

Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf

[Pre-Chorus]
A        E  
Over the laws of light
F        C 
Over the moon by midnight
A           E   
Let's do it all this time
F                Fmaj7
Everyone wishing well we go

[Chorus]
C    G   D  A  C    G   D  A 
Everyone knows anything goes
C          G   
We are the lotus kids
D           A 
Better take note of this
C       G   D   
For the story

[Verse 2]
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause john and jane would like to know

Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

[Pre-Chorus]
A        E  
Over the laws of light
F        C 
Over the moon by midnight
A           E   
Let's do it all this time
F                Fmaj7
Everyone wishing well we go

[Chorus]
C    G   D  A  C    G   D  A 
Everyone knows anything goes
C          G   
We are the lotus kids
D           A 
Better take note of this
C       G   D   
For the story

[Bridge]
A        E  
Over the laws of light
F        C 
Over the moon by midnight
A           E   
Let's do it all this time
F                C
Into the shed of showing
A        E  
Enter the rolling tide
F        C 
Over the ocean so wide
A        E  
Let's do it all this time
F                Fmaj7
Everyone wishing well we go

[Chorus] x3
C    G   D  A  C    G   D  A 
Everyone knows anything goes
C          G   
We are the lotus kids
D           A 
Better take note of this
C       G   D   
For the story
