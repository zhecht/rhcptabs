[Verse]

[ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
I--- got dosed by you and
[ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
Closer than most to you and
[ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
What am I supposed to do
[ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Take it away I never had it anyway
[ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Take it away everything will be okay

[ch]C[/ch]        [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
In you a star is born and
[ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
You cut a perfect form and
[ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Someone forever warm
[ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
[ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Lay on lay on lay on lay on


[Chorus 1]

[ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Way up on the mountain where she died
[ch]G[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch]  [ch]C[/ch]
All I ever wanted was your life
[ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
[ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
All I ever wanted was your life


[Verse]

[ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]    [ch]Em[/ch]
Show love with no remorse and
[ch]C[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Climb onto your seahorse and
[ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Em[/ch]
This ride is right on course
[ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]           [ch]Em[/ch]
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
[ch]C[/ch]                  [ch]D[/ch]                 [ch]Em[/ch]
This is the way I knew that it would be with you
[ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
[ch]C[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Lay on lay on lay on lay on

[ch]G[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
[ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em/G[/ch] (i think) ------ [ch]C2[/ch]
All I ever wanted was your life


[Verse] (it sounds good doing the picked part (from the beginning) here during this verse)

[ch]C[/ch]         [ch]D[/ch]       [ch]Em[/ch]
I--- got dosed by you and
[ch]C[/ch]            [ch]D[/ch]      [ch]Em[/ch]
Closer than most to you and
[ch]C[/ch]          [ch]D[/ch]          [ch]Em[/ch]
What am I supposed to do

(resume chords if you want, this is when the drums start again and we get
background vocals, Flea resumes the normal bass line)

[ch]C[/ch]              [ch]D[/ch]            [ch]Em[/ch]
Take it away I never had it anyways
[ch]C[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch]
Take it away and everything will be okay

[ch]G[/ch]             [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Way up on the mountain where she died
[ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]               [ch]Em[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
