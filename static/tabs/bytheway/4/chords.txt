[Verse]

C        D        Em
I--- got dosed by you and
C           D       Em
Closer than most to you and
C         D           Em
What am I supposed to do
C              D            Em
Take it away I never had it anyway
C            D               Em
Take it away everything will be okay

C        D       Em
In you a star is born and
C         D       Em
You cut a perfect form and
C         D      Em
Someone forever warm
C             D      Em
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
C             D      Em
Lay on lay on lay on lay on


[Chorus 1]

G             D                  Em C
Way up on the mountain where she died
G            D              Em  C
All I ever wanted was your life
G                D              Em C
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
G           D               Em C
All I ever wanted was your life


[Verse]

C              D    Em
Show love with no remorse and
C           D      Em
Climb onto your seahorse and
C             D        Em
This ride is right on course
C                  D           Em
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
C                  D                 Em
This is the way I knew that it would be with you
C             D      Em
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
C             D      Em
Lay on lay on lay on lay on

[Chorus 2]

G             D                  Em C
Way up on the mountain where she died
G           D               Em C
All I ever wanted was your life
G                D              Em C
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
G           D               Em/G (i think) ------ C2
All I ever wanted was your life


[Verse] (it sounds good doing the picked part (from the beginning) here during this verse)

C         D       Em
I--- got dosed by you and
C            D      Em
Closer than most to you and
C          D          Em
What am I supposed to do

(resume chords if you want, this is when the drums start again and we get
background vocals, Flea resumes the normal bass line)

C              D            Em
Take it away I never had it anyways
C                D               Em
Take it away and everything will be okay


[Chorus]

G             D                  Em C
Way up on the mountain where she died
G           D               Em C
All I ever wanted was your life
G                D              Em C
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
G          D               Em/G (I think) ------ C2
All I ever wanted was your life


[Solo] - either verse chords or picked part will work here
