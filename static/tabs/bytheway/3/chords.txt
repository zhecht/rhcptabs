Verse:
Am
This is the place, where all the junkies go
A                               Asus4       G Dsus4
Where time gets fast, but everything gets slow
Am
Can I get some Vaseline, step into a modern scene
Am
Take a chance on that, which seems to be the making of a dream
                G7
I don’t want to do it like my Daddy did
Am
I don’t want to give it to my baby’s kid


Chorus:
Am                 F
This is my calling I said my darling
Dm                  C
Shocking, appalling All I can do to you
Am                  F
Hammers are falling I said my darling
D7                  C

F Am D7


Verse 2:
Am
This is the place where all the devils plead
                            Asus4       G7  D7 D
Their case to take from you what they need
Am
Can I isolate your gene, can I kiss your dopamine

In a way I wonder if she’s living in a magazine
                G7
I don’t want to say it if it isn’t so
                Csus2                        Am
I don’t want to weigh it but I’ve got to know


Chorus:
Am                  F
This is my calling, I said my darling
D7                   C
Shocking, appalling, All I can do to you
Am                   F
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
D7                   C
Shocking, appalling, All I can do to you
F  Am  C  Asus4
 Oooh


Bridge:
F         C               Dsus4
I saw you out there yesterday, What did you want to say
F         C          Dsus4
A perfect piece of DNA, Caught in a flashing ray
F            C                Dsus4
I caught you out there in the fray, What did you want to say
F       C          Dsus4  
A masterpiece of DNA, Caught in a flashing ray


Verse 3:
Am7
Can I smell your gasoline, Can I pet your wolverine
D7
On the day my best friend died, I could not get my copper clean
G7
I don’t want to take it up, With Little Joe
Am
I don’t want to fake it, So I’ve got to go


Chorus:
Am                  F
This is my calling, I said my darling
D7                   C
Shocking, appalling, All I can do to you
Am                   F
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
D7                   G7
Shocking, appalling, All I can do to you


Outro:
Am            F
I’m a misfit, I’m born with all of it
Dm                       C
The fucking ultimate, Of love inside the atom split
Am                  F
I’m in a flash ray, A mash of DNA
D7                       C                              Am
Another poppin’ Jay, Who thinks he’s got something to say
