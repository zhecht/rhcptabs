decduff93: With the Dmaj if you find the chord diagram where its barred on the fifth i then take my pinky and move it to the same fret but on the hight e string.

Pretty sure the D is x 6 therefor it would last 3 beats, i dunno I'm not great with timing, i'm sure you'll figure it out.

  [Verse:]
 Shadow my free form
   A woman that I could keep warm
   Quiver for me girl
   Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story
   Shadow my free form
   A woman that I could keep warm

Love and glory
Sleeping next to you
And I'm in your dream
