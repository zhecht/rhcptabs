Nothing major or too complicated

etc.

Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated
For someone
Someone

Cut my heart out
With a feather
And put an end
To any extra pressure

For someone
There are no worries for
Someone
Life's in no hurry for
Someone
There are no worries for

Ride around on mellow waves of mercy
And fill the space with lack of controversy

For someone
Someone

Set it up to follow you
On my aeroplane
Here's a present
For the future memory lane

Someone
There are no worries for
Someone
Life's in no hurry for
Someone
There are no worries for

Light it up the room
She sang into any twane
In the month of June i'll be
A moth to your flame

Someone
There are no worries for
Someone
Life's in no hurry for
Someone
There are no worries for me
For me
For me
For me
