[Verse]
[ch]Em[/ch]
Can't stop addicted to the shindig 
[ch]D[/ch]
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Choose not a life of imitation 
[ch]C[/ch]
Distant cousin to the reservation 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Defunct the pistol that you pay for 
[ch]D[/ch]
This punk the feeling that you stay for 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
In time I want to be your best friend 
[ch]C[/ch]
Eastside love is living on the westend 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Knocked out but boy you better come to 
[ch]D[/ch]
Don't die you know the truth as some do 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Go write your message on the pavement 
[ch]C[/ch]
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant 
[ch]Em[/ch]
White heat is screaming in the jungle 
[ch]D[/ch]
Complete the motion if you stumble 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Go ask the dust for any answers 
[ch]C[/ch]
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers 

[Chorus]
     [ch]G[/ch]
The world I love 
     [ch]D[/ch]
The tears I've dropped 
   [ch]Bm[/ch]
To be part of 
     [ch]C[/ch]
the wave can't stop 
[ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Ever wonder if it's all for you
     [ch]G[/ch]
The world I love 
      [ch]D[/ch]
The trains I hop 
   [ch]Bm[/ch]
To be part of 
     [ch]C[/ch]
The wave can't stop 
 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Come and tell me when it's time to 

[Verse]
[ch]Em[/ch]
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone 
[ch]D[/ch]
So smart she's leading me to ozone 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Music the great communicator 
[ch]C[/ch]
Use two sticks to make it in the nature 
[ch]Em[/ch]
I'll get you into penetration 
[ch]D[/ch]
The gender of a generation 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
The birth of every other nation 
[ch]C[/ch]
Worth your weight the gold of meditation 
[ch]Em[/ch]
This chapter's going to be a close one 
[ch]D[/ch]
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
All on a spaceship persevering 
[ch]C[/ch]
Use my hands for everything but steering 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Can't stop the spirits when they need you 
[ch]D[/ch]
Mop tops are happy when they feed you 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Jay butterfly is in the treetop 
[ch]C[/ch]
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

[Chorus]
     [ch]G[/ch]
The world I love 
     [ch]D[/ch]
The tears I've dropped 
   [ch]Bm[/ch]
To be part of 
     [ch]C[/ch]
the wave can't stop 
[ch]G[/ch]           [ch]D[/ch]        [ch]Bm[/ch]      [ch]C[/ch]
Ever wonder if it's all for you
     [ch]G[/ch]
The world I love 
      [ch]D[/ch]
The trains I hop 
   [ch]Bm[/ch]
To be part of 
     [ch]C[/ch]
The wave can't stop 
 [ch]G[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]         [ch]Bm[/ch] [ch]C[/ch]
Come and tell me when it's time to

[Interlude]
[ch]Em[/ch]                 [ch]D[/ch]                   [ch]Bm[/ch]              [ch]C[/ch]
Wait a minute I'm passing out, win or lose, just like you 
[ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, how 'bout you 
[ch]Em[/ch]                [ch]D[/ch]                  [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you 
[ch]Em[/ch]                       [ch]D[/ch]              [ch]Bm[/ch]             [ch]C[/ch]
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, right on cue 

[Verse]
[ch]Em[/ch]
Can't stop addicted to the shindig 
[ch]D[/ch]
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Choose not a life of imitation 
[ch]C[/ch]
Distant cousin to the reservation 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Defunct the pistol that you pay for 
[ch]D[/ch]
This punk the feeling that you stay for 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
In time I want to be your best friend 
[ch]C[/ch]
Eastside love is living on the westend 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Knocked out but boy you better come to 
 [ch]D[/ch]
Don't die you know the truth as some do 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Go write your message on the pavement 
[ch]C[/ch]
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Kick start the golden generator 
[ch]D[/ch]
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Can't stop the Gods from engineering 
[ch]C[/ch]
Feel no need for any interfering 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Your image in the dictionary 
[ch]D[/ch]
This life is more than ordinary 
[ch]Bm[/ch]
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these 
[ch]C[/ch]
Comin' from space to teach you of the Pliedes 
[ch]Em[/ch]
Can't stop the spirits when they need you 
N.C.
This life is more than just a read-thru

idehass: very nice, this works perfect for a beginner rhythmist

c0nv1c2: coool very nice

jph007: Mate your Chorus is wrong its the same as the verse except when "Ever wonder if it's all for you" and   
"Come and tell me when it's time to" that bits right but with the rest its Em, D, Bm, C :)
