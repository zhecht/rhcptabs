Matmilloo: this G should be a G7 i think. at least in some places. i wonder whether it might not even be a Bm(b5)/G, but in practice it amounts to the same thing.

Title: Tear
 
[Intro]
C   G   Am
C   G   Am

[Verse 1]
C           G
This is my time
            Am
This is my tear
C           G
I can see clearly now
      Am
That this is not a place
For playing solitaire
C         G        Am
Tell me where you want me
C           G
This is my time
            Am
This is my tear

C            G
Comin' on strong
      Am
Baudelaire
 C       G
Seems to me like
        Am
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
 C      G      Am
Let it rise before you
 C           G
This is my crime

[Chorus]
C      C/B
All in all an' I'm
 Am           C/G
Loving every rise and fall
     F                Em
The sun will make and I will take
  F           G
Breath to be sure of this

C      C/B
In the endin' end
Am              C/G
All will be forgiven when
    F           Em
Surrender rises high and I
 F           G
Give what I came to give
Am
Say it now because you never know

[Verse 2]
C          G             Am
Devil may cry devil may care
C                   G
Distiller's got a scream
           Am
And now I know just why
When she's movin' air
C        G        Am
Can you feel the voltage
C           G
This is my time

[Verse 3]

California skies
             Am

This is my time

[Chorus]

In the endin' end
Am              C/G
All will be forgiven when
    F           Em
Surrender rises high and I

All the world gets high
When you take a dare
