trevdogafi: what is the strum pattern i got to know

Cap'n Crunch: Anywhere you have a D to a G (in the choruses), you need a Bm in between them.

[Intro]
Am   G   Em   F   x2

[Verse]
Am                               G
Can I get your hand to write on. Just a piece of leg to bite on
Em                              F
What a night to fly my kite on. Do you want to flash your light on
Am                            G        Em                     F
Take a look it’s on display … for you. Comin’ down, no not today

Am                                G
Did you meet your fortune teller. Get it off with no propeller
Em                             F
Do it up, it’s on with Stella. What a way to finally smell her
Am                             G        Em                         F
Pick it up, but not to strong … for you. Take a piece and pass it on

[Chorus]
D                      G         A
Fly away on my Zephyr. I feel it more than ever
D                            G            A
And in this perfect weather. We’ll find a place together
Am  G    Em  F
Fly on … my wind

[Verse]
Am                     G
Rebel and a liberator. Find a way to be a skater
Em                         F
Rev it up to levitate her. Super friendly aviator
Am                            G        Em                    F
Take a look it’s on display … for you. Comin’ down, no not today

[Chorus]
D                      G         A
Fly away on my Zephyr. I feel it more than ever
D                            G            A
And in this perfect weather. We’ll find a place together
D                                       G                 A
In the water where I center my emotion. All the world can pass me by
D                      G            A
Fly away on my Zephyr. We’ll find a place together

[Solo]
Am   G   Em   F   x2

[Interlude]
Am                              G
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa – do you
Em                              F
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Am                              G
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa – want to
Em                              F
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
D                      G         A
Fly away on my Zephyr. I feel it more than ever
D                            G            A
And in this perfect weather. We’ll find a place together
D                                       G                 A
In the water where I center my emotion. All the world can pass me by
D                      G            A
Fly away on my Zephyr. We’re gonna live forever

D       G    A

D       G    A
                Forever
D       G    A
