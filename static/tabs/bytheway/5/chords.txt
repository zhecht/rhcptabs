kevsis: this is the bass tab. if u watch them live its flea that plays this. the guitar is sumin like this for the verse
e-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0
b--------------------------------------
g--------------------------------------

e-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-5-7-
b-------------------------------------
g-------------------------------------
all hammer ons

   t p   t  p   t  p   t  p   t  p
e-10-8-5-10-8-5-10-8-5-10-8-5-10-8-5
b-----------------------------------
g-----------------------------------

t = tap and p = pull off
obviouls ythis is not the correct number of times u do this but you get the idea. thanks for the tab tho

kevsis: sorry in the correction i just made, the tapping bit u tap the 12th fret not the 10th

andrewbiles: yeah, the person above it right, you've written out the bass tab.
and the guitar comes in at "I'm a dancehall, dirty breakbeat" with the open e string.
then I just thought it went into the tapping unlike the person above, tapping like:
    t p p   t p p     t p p   t p p
e|-12p7p5--12p7p5-------------------
b|-------------------10p5p3--10p5p3-
g|----------------------------------

hope that's come out ok, but u get the idea.
then a bit further on it's 

    t p p   t p p
e|-12p7p5--12p8p5-

obviously that's not all the correct amount of times he taps, it's just giving u the idea of what he does.

but anyway, it sounds like u have the bass right!  should've mayb put that u strum the chord once then mute the strings 4 times or something to show the pattern for people
