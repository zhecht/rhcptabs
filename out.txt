Quite possibly the funkiest song the chilis have written in over 20 years? Let 'Em Cry intro + She's A Lover verse is legit "If You Want Me To Stay" (instrumentally) and i'm so here for it.

On first listen and still my favorite off the album, but that's a given since it's funky as shit. Amplified x10 with headphones, John's licks panning through on the left is a really nice touch (ie. [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5HLF92vf9U?t=21s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5HLF92vf9U?t=34s), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5HLF92vf9U?t=93s)).

- Flea's bassline during the chorus is so damn catchy that I find myself humming it over the words

- Loving John's backing vocals on this one. Anthony sounds prime too, this type of funk works sooo well with his timbre. 

- John + Flea during the solo compliment each other so fucking well, it's everything I've been missing from this dynamic. I really hope this bad boy gets on the live setlist.

- Anthony joining in on one last chorus during the solo/outro, YESSSS. it's just classic peppers.

I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH!
