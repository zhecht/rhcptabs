I made rhcptabs [5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedHotChiliPeppers/comments/6e19dz/wwwrhcptabscom_is_live_as_of_last_night/) off of one redditors suggestion that we should have something similar to fftabs.com.
  
So in a night, with some terrible code, I patched together rhcptabs which has been unchanged for basically that whole time.

UL coming out got me inspired to start working on it again. I added some more tabs, updated the tables, and made an email rhcptabs@protonmail.com where you can submit a link or PDF of any tab that is missing / inadequite

My sources: I basically just used ultimate-guitar links for all tabs. Finding the most upvoted/favorited tab. Are there some better drum/bass tab websites out there?

This album is starting to become one of my favorites. I can't wait to play along to that insanely funky Sly-inspired She's a Lover. This community was the reason i joined reddit 6+ years ago, and I'm really happy to be hearing new music with y'all again!
